He had done some important work in the fields of gamma radiation, and he had also learned more about gamma radiation the hard way.\nNow, he was trying to build both on that work and the life-changing accident. Becoming the Hulk had changed his life for better and for worse, and most of the worse aspects had to do with the lack of control he had felt for years when becoming Hulk. Over time, he had gotten more control, but it was still a struggle. Eventually he'd had an insight: What if he could control the infusion of gamma radiation into his body? Would it be possible to decide how much of a Hulk he wanted to be? \nThe question had led to a series of experiments, and now Bruce thought he was on the verge of a real working prototype of a device that could absorb, contain, and channel gamma radiation. \nIf so, it would be life-changing.\nSo here he was, tinkering with the final adjustments to what he was calling the Gamma Belt. The fundamental idea of the belt was that it contained a reservoir of gamma energy that could be channeled into the wearer's body.\nHe would never let anyone else use the belt, but if he could get it working, the transformation in Banner's life would be practically unthinkable. To have full control over the Hulk, without worrying about the mindless rages that had occasionally overtaken him for decades now? Banner had always found the Hulk as much a curse as a gift. There were times when it was great to be a super hero, but when you woke up one morning and discovered that the Hulk had leveled part of a city during a fight...\nSomething had to change. So now, Banner was changing something. \nIt was late at night, and the desert outside Banner's lab was quiet save for the eerie whistle of the breeze in the spines of the saguaro cactuses. It was a strange, lonely sound, perfect to accompany the work of a strange, lonely man. He shut the window and put the belt on, testing it for fit and making sure the gamma conduits were intact and not facing out. The Gamma Belt was designed to channel energy into the wearer's body, without letting it escape anywhere else. Banner had done this by lining the belt with conduits for the energy, and insulating the conduits in every direction except a small seam where the belt was in direct contact with the wearer. In testing, with the belt tightened around a mannikin, the insulation had worked. \nNow, he was going to find out if it worked on a real person.\nHe tightened the belt and settled it into place around his waist. Then he tested the gamma detectors he'd placed around the lab, making sure they were active. He'd arranged them to pick up any stray energy released when Banner activated the belt to become the Hulk.\nIt was going to feel strange to become the Hulk that way. For so many years, it had been just a sudden internal process. Now, Banner was trying to systematize it, channel it, make it not quite so vulnerable to his emotional states. In a way, putting his transformation under the control of an external object felt like losing control over it, even though the whole point of the Gamma Belt was to have better control over the Hulk. \nAnd, possibly, to make him stronger. Banner had run the math hundreds of times, and it was possible the Gamma Belt would be able to create a stronger Hulk. What that would mean for him, Banner wasn't sure. But he was about to find out.\nHe hadn't told anyone about the Gamma Belt, mostly because he didn't want to have a conversation about why he was building a device to do what he could already do. And the reason for avoiding that conversation was that Banner would have to admit that he wanted the belt to give him a kind of control over the Hulk that he'd never felt he could maintain. In other words, he didn't want to have a conversation about how he couldn't control the Hulk.\nOkay, he thought. Time to see if I've solved that problem.\nHe started a video camera set into one wall of the lab. \"Banner, Gamma Belt test. First go-round with a full energy reservoir.\"\nHe stepped to the center of the lab, where he'd marked out a spot for the transformation. Earlier that day, he'd moved all the lab furniture and equipment away from it.\n\"Commencing...\" He tapped a control on the belt. \"Now.\"\nLights on the belt flared to life as it poured gamma energy into the conduit encircling Bruce's waist. \nHe felt the transition like he always did: wrenching, painful, but also filling him with a sense of limitless power. Along with that came something even more important: ease. Where Banner was nearly crippled by anxieties about how other people felt about him, Hulk didn't care what anyone thought. He was Hulk!\nHe looked around Banner's lab, then down at the belt around his waist. How did Banner design it so it didn't break? \n\"Don't need the belt,\" Hulk grumbled. But he knew Banner had designed the experiment to help him, so Hulk reluctantly went ahead to do the rest of the steps Banner had planned in advance. At least they sounded like fun.\nFirst, Hulk went outside the lab, trudging down a dirt road that led into a box canyon. Banner had set up instruments along one wall of the canyon. Hulk was supposed to stand at the other wall and clap. Banner thought he could measure Hulk's strength this way. Hulk just wondered what the belt would do. \nHe stood by the canyon wall and looked at the instruments maybe twenty yards away. It was a narrow canyon. He took a deep breath, narrowed his eyes, and spread his arms wide.\nHulk's clap usually caused a shockwave strong enough to break windows, flip cars, and send Hulk's enemies flying. But when he brought his palms together and heard the ear-shattering CRACK, he knew right away that this clap was different.\nThe shock wave crashed against the far canyon wall like a bomb had gone off, collapsing the wall into a rockslide that buried Banner's instruments like they were never there. Then the wave rebounded and knocked Hulk into the wall at his back, hard enough to stun him — and bring thousands of tons of rock slabs crashing down on his head. Dazed, Hulk shook his head and flexed to push the rocks away...only to find that none of the rocks was touching him. A glowing sphere of gamma energy had surrounded him, projected from the belt. When Hulk moved, the sphere moved, shifting the rockfall so he could stand. Then it faded away.\nHulk looked down at the belt. \nIts reservoir was partly full. \nHulk looked across to the far wall. One of the instruments had survived the rockslide. Its microphone stuck up between rock slabs, and attached to it was a camera. Hulk walked to the camera and pointed down to the belt. \"See that?\"\nThen he decided to do another strength test and see what happened. He went outside, looked up to make sure no planes were going overhead, and jumped. He peaked a few thousand feet in the air, coming back down a short distance from his jump point with an impact that shook the windows in the lab. The arms of the saguaro cactuses waved. \nThe belt was two-thirds full. \nHulk grinned. \"Heh.\" \nNow he was going to try something even harder. He picked up a car parked near the lab and threw it into the air in a high arc. Before it could land, he thundered after it, leaping as it fell and smashing a fist into it before it could hit the ground. The car exploded into hundreds of pieces, its gas tank rupturing in a ball of flame that Hulk fell through back to the ground. He roared as he landed, an exultant roar that echoed out over the empty desert. \nThis was something Banner hadn't thought of. Becoming the Hulk, he had essentially given off enough gamma radiation to refill the belt...which in turn had fed the new radiation back into him. \nThe dose would have killed him...if he hadn't already survived a larger dose of gamma radiation years ago. Instead it made him...well, Hulkier.\nHe was a different Hulk. The real Hulk. The pure monster. He didn't care what Banner thought. Banner was weak. Hulk would rub Banner's face in it once and for all. \n\"Gonna show Banner,\" he growled to himself. \"Show him how puny he is when Hulk gets bigger!\"\nHulk stomped back into the lab and looked at the camera. Inside he felt Banner's fear and worry, deep inside his mind. He bared his teeth in a grin. \"See, Banner? More gamma, more Hulk. Gonna do it again!\"\nThat's not really a good idea. It was Banner's voice.\n\"Shut up, Banner.\"\nNo, you don't understand, if too much gamma radiation builds up, it could —\n\"SHUT UP!\" Hulk punctuated the roar with a double-fisted blow to the floor, coming down with all his strength. \nThe blast wave tore the concrete slab under the lab building to pieces and shattered equipment in every room. Sparks flew and cables tore out of the wall a moment before a row of lab tables smashed into the far side of the lab, breaking the window Banner had carefully shut before beginning the experiment. The roof started to come down, and Hulk roared as it destroyed itself over his head and shoulders.\nHulk, no—!\nHumiliating Banner felt good. Hulk wasn't done. \"Watch, Banner!\" he snarled, picking up a steel beam from the ceiling and smashing it to the ground, feeling bolts and fragments of concrete ricochet up from the floor off his invulnerable skin. Yes! He would tear the lab to the ground, and then —\nBanner collapsed to the floor among the smashed remains of his instruments, feeling the Hulk recede like a great tide of rage in his mind. He was breathing hard and saying \"no, no, no,\" until he realized he was saying it. When he stopped, the only sound in the lab was the whistling of the saguaro spines in the night breeze. Out in the desert, pieces of the car were burning slowly down. \nIn his hands he held the broken remains of the Gamma Belt. Ricocheting fragments of the lab table had punched through its electronics, returning him instantly to his Banner state. \"Interesting,\" he said. He hadn't considered that possibility.\nHe looked from the smashed remains of the Gamma Belt to the smashed remains of the lab, then out to the dirt track leading to the canyon. The remains of the car still burned at the edge of the desert.\nThere were a lot of things he hadn't considered. It was time to get back to work.",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10140010_HeroGalleryInfo_Story_#0_Content": "After their little disagreement in Tokyo, Frank Castle figured he'd never hear from Natasha and her worldwide squad of Red Room spies. But lo and behold, it wasn't even a few weeks after the sky fell apart that she found him in an open-air noodle shop nestled among Shanghai warehouses down by the flood-control walls along the Huangpu River. The towers gleamed in the night sky, their upper floors hidden by clouds. It had just started raining. \"Your kind of neighborhood,\" she commented as she took a seat opposite him.\n\"Honest working people.\" Frank said. \"Food ain't half bad either. I had better noodles on Canal Street, though. You stop by to tell me I'm wanted in Shanghai too?\"\nNatasha shook her head. \"Haven't checked. I found you because I need a word.\"\nFrank slurped his noodle broth.\n\"We saw what happened in Tokyo. Maybe we should be working together,\" she spoke bluntly, causing Frank to crack a smile, just long enough to let her see it. \n\"I was kidding.\"\n\"I'm not.\" \nHe looked at her while recalling what he saw in the sky just a few minutes after he took out some rogue androids, apparently blowing up her mission. It looked like some so-called super villain did something to the sky. Like the old days in New York City when something crazy happened every other hour. Then the sky over Tokyo was different, and Frank couldn't kid himself. A lot of other things were different too.\n\"So what have you been doing since Tokyo?\" she asked.\nHer tone told Frank that she already knew, so he played it straight. \"Went back home for a bit. Cleaned up some criminal scum. Then I thought maybe I could help them more by getting after Doom again. I kidnapped one of his engineers, tried to find out what he's working on in Doomstadt. Learned enough to know that I had to come to Shanghai.\"\n\"And do what?\"\nFrank pressed his thumb on a reader set into the noodle shop's counter. It chirped. He stood and turned his collar up against the rain. \"Come on,\" he said.\nBy the time they got up on the flood wall, the rain was coming down in sheets. He couldn't see across the river to the old International Concession. \"Been here before?\" he asked Natasha.\n\"I've been just about everywhere,\" she said. \"First time I came to Shanghai was back in the 1980s. It's changed a lot.\"\nFrank nodded. Shanghai changed fast, and the 1980s were a long time ago. \"I mostly stayed in the States after I got home. But once I got the treatment, life got a lot longer. Thought I had more ... scope, I guess ... to take on some bigger problems, 'cause the more things changed, the more I realized that the world was staying the same...unless I changed it.\" He stood listening to the rain, thinking about it. He knew Natasha had undergone the same life-extension treatments he had, but in the moment, it didn't seem to bind them together. She'd used her extra decades to retake control of the Red Room and become the leader of an international spy network. Talk about healing childhood trauma. On the other hand, Frank had used his time to escalate his war on criminal scum from street-level punks and neighborhood gangsters to international traffickers. He tracked them patiently, over years, and when he had the right situation, he made them pay. \"Sometimes I think maybe I should have stayed in New York.\"\n\"They do have good noodles.\" Natasha joked dryly. \"Why are we here, Frank?\"\nFrank pointed at a row of piers across the Huangpu River, barely visible through the heavy rain and the mist coming up off the river. \"Blue hull, single stack, no containers on the deck but it's riding real low. See it?\" Natasha nodded. \"That ship flies a Madripoor flag, but it's running cargo for Doom. Special cargo this time. It's headed out to the Philippine Sea. When it gets into international waters and it's far enough to avoid anti-missile defense systems, it's going to launch a satellite. Something about locking down any space transport coming from Earth, if the engineer was telling me the truth.\" Frank chuckled. \"Which I think he was.\"\n\"More than that, Frank. I think it has something to do with what happened in Tokyo,\" Natasha added.\n\"Most likely,\" Frank knew it wasn't in his best interest to think too hard about the weirder things. Crime was crime, and he gravitated towards problems with permanent solutions.\n\"Nice work, Frank,\" Natasha said, a bit grudgingly. \"We had the ship pegged, but we didn't know what it was carrying.\"\n\"Well, Widow, I might spend most of my time getting rid of criminal scum, but I'm not too shabby at paying attention and gathering intel. I don't always go around indulging my trigger-happy vigilante impulses.\"\nHe was giving her a hard time because she'd called him a loose cannon in Tokyo and he was still mad about it. She didn't take the bait. \"So sink it,\" she said instead. \"I'm sure you've got a stash of goodies somewhere that'll do the trick.\"\n\"Not at the pier. People work there. If I sink a ship at the port, it'll be weeks until they can work.\" He could see on her face that she hadn't thought about this. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"You've got to think about the regular person, the little person. Law-abiding, trying to get through the day. In the Red Room, those people are all just collateral damage, am I right?\"\n\"Maybe in the old days. Now, we're all collateral damage in somebody's plan, Frank,\" she said, looking him dead in the eye. But he thought he'd made his point.\n\"Anyway, yeah,\" he said. \"Sinking it is the plan. Just not right here in the port. The other thing is, unless we blow it sky-high, Doom can just salvage the satellite and put it on another boat.\"\n\"Noted. So what's your plan?\"\n\"You serious?\"\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"We'll do it your way. Then I want you to hear me out.\"\nShe stuck out a hand. He shook it and she said, \"Now can we get out of the rain?\"\nVisibility in the Huangpu approached zero even in daylight, and at night it was like being in a sensory deprivation tank. Frank couldn't risk garnering attention, so no lights. Instead he used passive sonar. The river bottom was a junkyard, sunken boats and other lost industrial relics stuck in the silt. Frank's scuba suit sported an advanced rebreather instead of an old-fashioned oxygen tank, so he didn't give off bubbles and didn't have to worry about getting air hoses tangled up. The bulk of the ship loomed overhead, drawing maybe twelve meters of water. That didn't leave much space under the keel for Frank to work his way in and set the charges, but he was able to lay twelve of them, six on either side of the keel, and then a bonus thirteenth at the very stern, near the rudder. Each was a kilo of his own explosive concoction shaped to punch inward. One perk of being at perpetual war for decades: you learned a lot about making your own ordnance. Widow had done some advanced surveillance, and the hull wasn't armored. The charges would each rip a hole the size of Frank's van in the ship's hull. \nFrogman work wasn't really his style. He'd done it a few times but he wasn't a fan. About a hundred years ago he'd seen a guy eaten by a shark. The guy was murdering scum and deserved it, but that didn't make Frank love being underwater. \nAfter a careful swim back downriver and across to the industrial flats, he stripped off the scuba suit. Natasha helped him stash it near the seawall inside an abandoned car. \"Everything go okay?\" she asked.\n\"Yeah,\" Frank said. \"Don't need a bath now.\"\nThey didn't want to draw attention to themselves, so they stayed perched atop a Red Room safe house in the old French Concession. Natasha piloted an infra-detector drone that stayed a few kilometers above and behind the old container ship as it wallowed through the Philippine Sea toward international waters. \"There it is,\" Frank said as the ship's deck slid open, revealing a launch gantry that lifted toward vertical. The rocket was small, and Frank snorted when he saw the painted Latverian flag on its nose cone.\n\"He's got an ego, doesn't he?\" Black Widow observed. She held the drone control out to Frank. \"You want to do the honors?\"\nHe took the control and patched the visual feed into a visor lens he'd been wearing for hours. The detector's view appeared before him like he was looking down from above and behind it. \nSmoke spurted from the inside of the ship as the rocket's engines began their pre-ignition sequence. \"Doom, you scum, I hope you're watching,\" Frank said, and triggered the detonator. \nThe ocean around the ship heaved and the launch gantry tipped to a twenty-degree angle. A moment later a huge belch of fire blasted upward from inside the ship. The rocket's engine ignited, but before it could lift off the gantry swung again, smashing into the ship's superstructure. Flaming wreckage from a second series of explosions arced into the sky and fell into the sea in blasts of steam. The ship itself was settling fast, heeling over to port as its stern disappeared. The rocket stayed in the gantry, thruster sputtering. Not five minutes after the charges detonated, the freighter and rocket were gone as if they had never existed. \n\"What's the depth here?\" Frank wondered.\n\"Seven thousand meters, give or take,\" Natasha said. \"That satellite's not coming back up. Doom's going to be furious.\"\n\"Better than him being happy.\" Frank set down the drone control and took off the visor. \n\"Wait,\" Natasha said. She picked the control up again and watched the monitor. The water was still churning where the ship had sunk, but now as they watched the ocean's surface really started to boil. \nThrough the swirling foam, the rocket, and its satellite payload, rose slowly into the air.\n\"You gotta be kidding me,\" Frank said. \nWobbling to stay vertical, the rocket cleared the surface. Its thrusters flared brighter and it accelerated upward.\nNatasha touched a fast series of commands on the infra-detector's control. The drone ascended in parallel with the rocket. \"You planning to crash it?\" Frank asked. \"That rocket's gonna be way too fast in a minute.\"\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"But I don't need that long.\"\nShe stood up from her controls, reaching into her gear with focused swiftness. Within moments, she lifted a massive weapon to her shoulder and took aim as the firearm announced \"ELECTROPLASM RIFLE CHARGED.\"\n\"Electroplasm rifle?\" Partly Frank was wondering why she hadn't mentioned the drone was a flying target, and partly he was wondering where he could get an electroplasm rifle of his own. \n\"My little failsafe,\" Natasha said. She breathed deeply and fired the shot.\nOn the screen, the discharge of the electroplasm rifle whited out the screen as it annihilated the rocket, and the drone with it. From their perch, Frank watched fragments of the rocket spiral out of the sky, below a massive fireball that dissipated into tendrils of smoke. Gobs of electroplasma fell along with the wreckage, crackling as they hit the surface of the ocean.\n\"A shame to lose the infra-detector,\" Natasha said, \"But a small price to pay to finish the job.\"\n\"You didn't trust me to get it done?\" Frank said.\n\"Of course I trusted you, Frank. You said you were going to blow up the ship, and you did.\" As she spoke, Natasha commanded the agents at the closest Red Room safe house to mobilize. Her spy network would make it disappear. \"But I also know we're dealing with Doom here, and if there's one thing we all need to know, it's that when you go up against Doom, you need a backup plan. So.\" She shrugged. \"That's what I did.\"\nHe understood, even if he still felt like she should have told him she was doing it. \"Guess we ended up working together after all.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Natasha said. \"We should do it again.\"\n\"Maybe,\" he said. \"If this op is any indication, we got some kinks to iron out. Also, I want an electroplasm rifle.\"\nShe gave him a sideways smile, revealing nothing. \"I'm putting together a team, you know. A few people who aren't afraid of unconventional methods. Maybe they've got what you might call a checkered past. But now they're trying to do what's right for the little guy. Like those dockworkers back in Shanghai. They'll be able to go to work tomorrow.\"\n\"So, doing good, sticking up for the downtrodden? What are we, knights?\"\n\"Beats being driven by revenge and a death wish,\" Natasha said.\nFrank considered this. He'd forgotten what it had been like to not be on the warpath solo. And if the sky was falling, maybe he did need a hand. \"If you say so. Yeah. Okay. I'm in.\"",

Ororo Munroe was one, and she had long looked forward to the day when the two sentient islands might be reunited. She had not, however, counted on it happening quite like this. , It had begun without her even knowing, while she was walking along the coral shoals that, together with a great oceanic lagoon, separated Arakko from the great red desert of Mars. The tiny whirls and eddies in time grew almost instantly into a great wave of disruption. Ordinarily, Storm was hypersensitive to tiny changes in the atmosphere around her, due to the nature of her Mutant powers, but she had been preoccupied with the next challenge to her seat on the Great Ring, and let that preoccupation distract her from her immediate sensory environment. \nNow aware that something was happening before she understood what, her pulse quickened, then slowed again to a thud. Raindrops slowed, hung still in the air, then hurtled again toward the ground, each one at a different speed. Clouds tore across the sky, cleared, then rebuilt themselves into great black walls, all in seconds — behind them the sky inverting its normal uniform brilliant blue. Streaks of indigo and black split from horizon to horizon, revealing stars that were not the stars Storm knew.\nShe raised a hand and saw raindrops falling on her skin — and others passing straight through her hand as if they weren't there. All around her plants grew, bloomed, and died, all in an instant. Trees split the skies, growing two hundred feet high and toppling, becoming soil again before their falling trunks even hit the ground. The air was thick with flowers, and insects moving through a million generations before her eyes as she drew a single breath.\nArakko and Krakoa both appeared before her, partly as if they were superimposed on each other. Then Ororo realized she was seeing it wrong; the two islands were colliding, molding into one another as the overlapping timelines tore away all boundaries of sense. The Red Keep and the Tower of Broken Will overlapped, merged, hybridized, and became something new that Storm couldn't quite focus on before it was all swept away in the next spasm of the time disruption. Krakoa's bays and Arakko's coral swirled into new configurations. Krakoa's quarry and the Circle Perilous of Arakko blended into each other before finally breaking free, but now the quarry contained Arakkan combatants and the Circle Perilous bewildered mutants of Krakoa. The forests of both islands overgrew each other and separated again, each featuring new species and unknown hybrids. The harder the wind blew, the faster the transformations, and now Storm saw tiny slivers of some new material appearing in the tempest, sleeting down to the island's surface and shores. The particles stung when they hit her skin — a pain that wasn't entirely physical. It was as if they were injuring her ability to locate herself in space and time. She reeled momentarily, then got her bearings again\nThe particles rained down over the islands, driving both into a frenzy. Arakko and Krakoa briefly fought each other, bitter as only siblings can be. Storm, standing on their soil with one foot in each world, knew she would be subsumed and destroyed if she did not do something. And as deformed time tore through her being again, rippling her mind the way wind would ripple her hair, she realized what she could do.\nThis was a storm across all of time. \nAnd if it was a storm, she could control it.\nStorm's power over weather was instinctive and had been since she was a girl. This was new and would not be guided by instinct but by her conscious mind — which was under constant distraction by the onslaught of particles. They ruined her concentration, and kept her from grounding herself in the here and now, which was necessary if she was to bring her powers to bear on this tumult. \nAnd she was not the only one suffering from the particles. The islands, brutally crushed into each other's reality, wailed in pain and fear, both a sound like a hurricane wind and a psychic scream that rang in Storm's mind. This spurred her into action. She may have been the Regent of Arakko, but she still had responsibilities to Krakoa as well. \nThe time-storm was forcing them together, and also twisting a new reality into being around them. Storm felt those currents of power, realized they moved in a system, and for a moment understood that system. Her Mutant powers responded. The way electrical charges crackled about her body when she controlled lightning, now space-time itself rippled around her body, creating glimpses of a million different Ororo Munroes from a million different realities, but none of them could disturb or displace her. She found herself in control, and she began to quiet the storm. Its boundaries, she knew, extended far beyond her ability to control it, but she had influence over this one small part, and that she intended to use. Krakoa and Arakko were at stake, and with them, the lives of thousands of mutants who would otherwise be adrift on the timestream. She could not let the time-storm merge the two islands together. The islands both feared for their survival, and they began to tear at one another psychically, with greater intensity as their fear created a feedback loop. \nOnly Storm could stop this madness. She began to guide the currents of the storm, shunting away the most damaging gusts and finding smoother paths for both Krakoa and Arakko to move through...time? Was she guiding them through time, the way a skilled ship's captain brought a vessel through a storm to safer harbors? If so, where would they arrive? \nGradually, slowly, she channeled the powers of the time-storm around the two living islands, letting them re-divide into their own entities, drifting further and further apart. Heavier fronts of the stinging particles blew through, and now they were larger, merging into crystals. They precipitated from the storm the way rain precipitated from clouds too heavy with moisture. Who had caused this time-storm? How were different realities becoming entangled and overlaid on each other? \nThese were questions for another time. Now she had to make sure the storm was passing, and not just gathering itself for another onslaught. She felt its energy dwindle, even as the crystals fell in greater numbers all around her, all across the islands' surface—and as she had that thought, she looked around and realized that the chronal outburst had subsided. \nKrakoa and Arakko had nearly become one, in a collapse that could have destroyed them both, and doubtless would have annihilated many of the lives on each. The aftershocks and echoes of their psychic battle still churned in the air around her, but like the time-storm, that battle was almost over. Storm stood on the coastline of Krakoa gazing out at the ocean, and...\nWait. When the time-storm had begun, Storm had been on Mars. On Arakko. Now, as reality settled back into place, she saw that she was on Krakoa, at the edge of Hellfire Bay, where the White Palace and Blackstone stared each other down from opposing promontories. The air smelled new, sharp with life and the scent of a just-passed storm — but it was definitely Earth air. Ororo looked around her, over beautiful living Krakoa, and despite her jarring dislocation, she felt an almost maternal pride at the way she had brought it through the crisis.\nBut how had it happened? And now that it was over, how had Storm been transported millions of miles without ever passing through a Krakoan gateway? Had Arakko been safely returned to its home on Mars? Was this even the same timeline that the living islands had occupied before the time-storm? It had been more powerful than anything she had ever felt, maybe even more powerful than her brief contact with the Phoenix Force. Who had caused it, and how? More importantly, why? What damage had been done to the mutants living on both islands? How could she ensure this did not happen again? These were a leader's questions. More personally, Storm was anxious to know that her friends and loved ones were all right. She would have to seek them out, both on Krakoa and Arakko, to make sure they had weathered the time-storm. And what of the broader world? What was the situation in New York, or Wakanda? Would she even find the same New York, or the same Wakanda, that she had once known? \nAll around her, the crystals precipitated from the storm lay thick on the ground. Storm bent and gathered several of them in her hand. Like a mineral made of time, she thought. \nXavier needed to hear about this immediately. Magneto as well, although Storm decided on the spot that Xavier should know first. Both old adversaries believed themselves to have Mutants' best interests in mind, but Storm's vision aligned much more closely with Xavier's. \nWhere was he? Here on Krakoa, or elsewhere in this world? Was it a new world, a new time, or had she misunderstood the nature of the storm?\nStorm saw people emerging from the forests of Krakoa. Some of them she recognized, some were new to her. They saw her, high on the ridge overlooking the ocean, and they looked to her for guidance. No matter where they hailed from — Krakoa or Arakko, Earth or Mars, the past, present, or future — she knew one thing: She would not let them down. "

But his true nature could not be undone, and Loki would come to fully embrace his role as the God of Mischief.\nWith his father deep in the Odinsleep, Loki seized his chance to take the throne for himself. After enlisting Hela in his plot and hurling his brother Thor into a distant timeline, Loki now harvests Chronovium sap from the World Tree, Yggdrasill, in an effort to conquer the entire timestream.",
    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10160010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "In the immediate aftermath of the reckless mortals' clumsy scrambling of timelines, Loki noticed something quite curious. The sap bleeding from Yggdrasil had a new, particularly magical essence. \nHe began to experiment with it. Shape it. Concentrate and intensify it. Time, he discovered, was the core of its essence, and right away, he conceived an intense desire to visit a future Asgard to see what mischief he might make there.\nQuickly, he learned how to do just that, but he came away not only disappointed but frightened and—not that he ever would have admitted it—saddened. For the future Asgard he beheld was a ruin, its throne broken and cast down, its collections looted, its surviving people grubbing in the ruins to survive.\nNo, Loki thought. Surely this is not Asgard's only future.\nHe brewed the enchantment once more...and discovered an Asgard overrun by Jotun, with Laufey himself grunting on the throne and Asgard's people little more than bones.\nAnd another Asgard in flames, with Surtur bestride the blazing trunk of Yggdrasil while the fabled towers of the realm collapsed in fiery rubble.\nAnd another, windswept and empty, the Cask of Eternal Winters broken open in the throne room.\nAnd another, shattered into drifting fragments against a sea of stars.\nAnd another, impossibly sunk under an ocean, with vast shadows moving in the moonlit waters above.\nHundreds more, thousands more. Asgards burned, Asgards frozen, Asgards overrun by Dark Elves or dwarves or enemies from Midgard or the worlds beyond the stars. A Kree-devastated Asgard, an Asgard ravaged by the Eternals, an Asgard ruled by an alien overlord whose minions oozed and sprang like living shadows, hunting down the last of the realm's true subjects. In all of these, Loki did not find the one thing for which he truly searched.\nHimself.\nAnd then, at last, an Asgard mighty and unbroken. An Asgard overarched by Yggdrasil's branches and underpinned by Yggdrasil's roots. Her towers shining, her people vibrant and untroubled, her wealth untouched...and her throne occupied by Loki.\nHe reeled back into his own time, mind aflame with the implications of what he had seen. How many destroyed Asgards had he witnessed? After all that, to see the one surviving realm be ruled by himself...\nWell, Loki thought. The only Asgard that survives this absurd misadventure is one in which my true destiny is at last acknowledged, my primacy accepted, my sovereignty celebrated. As it should be. Now remains the work of bringing this future to pass.\nImmediately the crucial points of the plan presented themselves to him. First, or course, he would have to maneuver the All-Father into the deep enchanted slumber of Odinsleep. Tricky, but he had done it before. The biggest obstacle was making sure that Heimdall didn't notice until it was too late. Then, Loki would use Thor's desire to help their father against him, guiding him into a certain place where Loki wouldn't have to worry about him for a long time.\nBut these were powerful enchantments, even for Loki. He was going to need to bring in a co-conspirator or two. It would be easy enough to betray them and rid himself of them later, but for a brief time they would be useful. Karnilla, of course. Aligning with the Norns was an absolute necessity if he were to retain rule over Asgard and not see it suffer any of the tragic fates he had witnessed. And while a master of magic, the Queen of the Norns was no great schemer — at least not compared to the God of Lies. \nHe also thought of Karnilla's closest ally, Hela. She was family, after all, and these kinds of things should be kept in the family whenever possible. Also, she would be useful because of her vast power and unlimited legions, who would keep the Valkyrior and Crimson Hawks busy, leaving the throne unguarded...\nIf Loki could just figure out what to offer Hela in return.\n\t*\nHe manifested in her realm unannounced, just because he could, and he knew it annoyed her. As soon as she sensed his presence, Hela sent an escort. This time, it was a retinue of fallen Asgardian warriors riding skeletal horses and singing the ghostly songs of the Asgardian dead who never made it to Valhalla. To the accompaniment of these mournful, discordant strains, Loki followed his escort to Hela's throne. In this kingdom, bones twisted by dark magic paved the path to her castle while particularly favored souls became feasts for her Nastrond crows. Loki hated the décor even more than he hated the thought of Thor sitting on the throne of Asgard. Well, perhaps not quite that much.\nAnd speaking of thrones, Hela sat on hers, regarding him with an imperious and icy stare as he approached and the ghostly retinue vanished. \"Loki,\" she said. \"Whatever foolish scheme has brought you here, be assured it will not succeed. Return to your realm and disturb me no further.\"\n\"O sister, great queen, it—\"\n\"Whenever you call me queen, Loki—or, for that matter, sister— I know you want something. Tell me what it is and spare me the insincere implication that you care about family.\"\n\"Oh, I do,\" he said. \"I do very much. Our family rules realms, and we have a responsibility to rule them as well as possible. Unfortunately, we are not currently doing that, because I am not ruling Asgard. I propose to rectify this error, and —\"\n\"And you want my help.\"\n\"Yes,\" Loki said. \"My plan will succeed with or without you, but as I said, we're family, and — \"\nFor the third time, she interrupted him. \"Why should I?\"\n\"Why, to be rid of the All-Father, whose time is past — and to be rid of our beloved Odinson, who would otherwise succeed to the throne of Asgard.\"\n\"Which is the one thing you cannot stand to see happen.\" \nLoki did not give her the satisfaction of agreeing. \n\"You see, Loki,\" Hela said, \"of all master plotters you are the easiest to predict because all of your plots are ultimately only about one thing.\"\nLoki inclined his head, again unwilling to make a verbal acknowledgement. \n\"You have been working new magic. I smell it on you,\" Hela said. \"Tell me.\"\n\"Ah. The sap of Yggdrasil. Observe.\" Loki cut a small notch in one of the World-Tree's roots. As the sap oozed out, he captured it and began to work a charm to extract its essence. \"As the World-Tree shapes the limits of our realms,\" he said, \"this substance shapes the limits of our time.\" After a moment he held a small ball of what looked like amber in the palm of his hand. \"Take it. It will show you the future of your realm just as it showed me the future of mine.\"\n\"Yours? You speak of Asgard?\"\n\"Yes,\" Loki said. \"That is why I wanted to see you.\"\nHe placed the ball in Hela's hand and began to describe what he had seen.\n*\n\"Ah,\" she said when they had returned from the visionary voyage. \n\"Yes, it is quite deserving of an 'ah,'\" Loki said. \"But the real question is, will you help me?\"\n\"I will,\" Hela said. \"But I have my own vision for this — Chronovium — for it has fallen in my realm as well. In return for my help, you will help me bring this vision to fruition.\"\n\"Of course,\" Loki said, intending it to be a lie — but not even he knew when an attempted lie might become an inadvertent truth.",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10180010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "Very little of consequence happened in the realms of the arcane without Stephen Strange taking note. He sensed unusual emanations from Latveria over a period of weeks, and eventually Strange decided that if Victor von Doom was creating such an obvious series of disturbances, a little astral surveillance was in order.\n\"Wong,\" he said. \"I'll be on the astral plane for a few hours. I hope no disaster befalls the Sanctum while I'm indisposed.\"\n\"I'll handle whatever comes up,\" Wong answered.\nStrange retreated to the innermost chamber of the Sanctum, near the collections of artifacts and relics from the Vishanti and other eminent magical beings. Here he felt most at home, most centered...most powerful. Here it was safest to perform an astral projection.\nHe closed his eyes, mouthed the spell without speaking aloud, and felt his spirit lift out of his body and drift across the invisible barrier separating the material dimensions—ordinary space-time—from the endless realm of the astral plane.\nStrange oriented himself in this arcane dimension, where things like direction and location operated on principles unknown to ordinary material existence, before beginning his astral journey toward Latveria, intending to observe Doomstadt from a prudent distance. \nHe could see Doomstadt's astral presence ahead, its occult energies spreading in waves from an intense locus of magical power. Victor was up to something, that much was certain...\nThe locus flared into a blinding sphere, casting off tendrils of astral energy as it spun.\nIt flattened into a torus, spinning ever faster—and then it tore itself apart in an explosion that hit Strange's astral self with a force that nearly shredded him into tiny particles of paralyzed awareness. \nA wrenching distortion blasted through the entirety of the astral space around Strange, nearly severing his link to his mortal body back in the Sanctum Sanctorum. He locked in on that distant tug, using the anchor of his physical self to keep his projected astral form coherent as the energy tsunami scattered the other projections. \nFor a moment, he felt the astral link stretched to its ultimate thinness. \nHe sensed the void that consumed all other projections as they were severed from their physical bodies. It spread around him, infinite and hungry, waiting for his astral soul to dissolve into its emptiness—\nNo! Strange fought back. He closed his eyes and let the Eye of Agamotto see for him. It showed him the shining thread of his connection to the physical world, and Strange devoted all his power to keeping that link intact. \nHe felt countless other Stephen Stranges, overlaid on him, radiating the same emotions he felt—confusion, resolve, anger at the thought that some malevolent force had unleashed this disaster. \nThe wave of distortion reached across timelines, across dimensions, tangling them and dissolving them into one another. \nStrange felt the boundaries of his mind grow porous, his soul beginning to leak away. Only the most desperate measures—only dark magic—would save him. \nHe reached out into the void itself, tapping its negative energy and working an enchantment forbidden to any student of the Ancient One. He would pay a price for it, but Strange knew no other way to survive. \nFrom the very material of the void, Strange called into being a tiny sphere of pure psychic energy, poured himself into it, let it expand to contain him and form an invulnerable barrier. \nAgainst the emptiness of the void, it held firm, and Strange felt the edges of his mind knit themselves back together again. His sensation of the other Stephen Stranges dimmed and faded away. \nHow many of them had managed to do what he had done, and how many had been erased from existence?\nHe would never know. All that mattered was that when the wave of distortion had passed, Strange could still feel the link to his body. His astral self was intact, and so was the physical Stephen Strange, Sorcerer Supreme.\nBut something was different. He was—could it be? Was it possible?\nHis astral self was still linked to his physical body, but his physical body was no longer within the Sanctum Sanctorum...and around the Sanctum Sanctorum, New York had changed. All this he could feel even across the vast interplanar distance. \nForbidden magic always exacted its price.\nThe shock of this brought Strange to the edge of the void again, and again he drew himself back. He was Sorcerer Supreme. Earth—all Earths—depended on him, and he would meet his obligations. He would return to Earth, whichever Earth this was, and begin to restore the order that had been so cataclysmically destroyed. \nThat would mean a confrontation with Doom. Possibly more than one Doom? Strange's arcane senses, attuned to the presence of other powerful magicians, picked out...two Dooms? More?\nHe would not be certain until he returned to the material plane. Then he would begin the work of sorting out what Doom had done, and undoing it.\nIt would be a grim task. Doom was a formidable enemy. \nBut so was Doctor Strange.\nHe began the enchantment to return himself to his physical body — but before he could complete it, the vision of Agamotto's Eye failed him. \nThe link to his body dimmed and was lost. New York was lost, the Sanctum Sanctorum was lost. The astral plane was just as chaotic and entangled as the material worlds it linked. All were devastated and transformed by Doom's cataclysm. \nHow much time passed in the aftermath of this shock, Strange did not know. Measuring time in the astral plane was no simple task under ordinary circumstances, and these were anything but. He held himself together, remained coherent, seized his fear and used his will to shape it into resolve. \nStephen Strange, Sorcerer Supreme of Earth, was no raw initiate. \nHe would not panic, even though centuries might have passed in the physical world and the very fabric of reality frayed to nothingness around him—although currently the problem was not nothingness, but rather too many realities, overlaid and entangled like wreckage when a great wave recedes.\nEach bit of that wreckage belonged somewhere. It was part of a pattern. If he could but discern that pattern...\nStrange reached out with the senses only a magical adept possessed. Again he began to perceive other Stephen Stranges...and other Sorcerer Supremes.\nSome seemed familiar to him, universes where Jericho Drumm or Daimon Hellstrom or his own daughter Sofia had become Sorcerer Supreme. Others were too outlandish to contemplate, cosmic jokes he passed over as if he had received a direct insult from the universe itself. All the while, he tried to reestablish a connection to himself, to the New York he could sense all around him, but from which he was barred.\nAll the while, worlds spun around their suns.\nAnd then, a different sensation—A world unraveling under the stress of Doom's dimensional rupture, held together by a power that was not the same arcane might one received from the Vishanti, or training under the Ancient One at Kamar-Taj. \nIn this world, the chaos of dissolution itself was transformed into an intricate and incredible structure, holding the world's boundaries fast against the void beyond. It was an undertaking that must drain immense power from the adept who tried to maintain it, he thought. Few could hope to begin it, and even fewer to keep it going. \nHe touched the chaos structure, and it rang in his mind with a familiar identity behind it. Here was his chance. \nStrange poured all of himself into one coherent plea, not knowing how much longer he would be able to maintain his own boundaries in the vast formlessness of this entangled astral plane. She was not of his world, perhaps, but at least she was of a world. He needed to find a way back to his body. \nHe pushed against the structure where it penetrated into the astral plane, following its contours until he had located her.\nWould she know him? Had too much time passed? Was the name Strange utterly forgotten, or...\nWanda, he cried out telepathically. Wanda, it's Stephen Strange. I need your help.",

One moment she had been with her fellow Guardians and the next...\n\"Fascinating,\" the Collector said. \"There is about to be a vacancy. I hope you last longer...\"\nShe waited for her moment as the Collector fiddled the displays in his new Theme Park. He made her a display, ready to display her to his audiences inside a glass-walled tank featured prominently in a vast hall filled with other life forms the intergalactic Master of the Universe found interesting. Many were humanoid, but the others ran the spectrum of physical shapes from globs of protoplasm to members of the Brood, their hive mind forcing a constant thrum in the back of Mantis' mind. It was tough being a telepath sometimes, especially in the presence of so many fearful minds reaching out from their cages.\nOne of those minds was peculiar and interesting to her. Unlike the others, it was all excitement, emotions turned all the way up, like every thought it had ended in multiple exclamation points. He was full of a kind of joy that Mantis found infectious, even though she was held prisoner in a psychotic museum in deep space a thousand light-years from the nearest planet. \nJeff. Jeff!\nShe smiled at his name and thought, I would very much like to meet you, Jeff.\n!!!!!!!\nAnother mind, physically closer to Mantis, also drew her attention. A human woman whose mind teemed with memories of war. No, not human, something close...She was a deadly warrior. Mantis, who knew a little something about being deadly herself, thought that if she ever managed to escape, she might enjoy taking the battlefield with this woman. She called herself after the weapons she wielded: Sai. But in her mind was a deeper name, one Mantis would have to ask if she ever got to talk with this warrior. \nThat's far enough, get out.\nAnd with that, Mantis lost her connection to Sai. She was psionic, and even that last thought screamed vengeance, so she returned to listen to Jeff for a little additional dose of optimism.\nThere were so many others, but Mantis enjoyed the company of these two. Jeff because of his irrepressible joy, and the few bits of Sai because she put Mantis in mind of escape, and revenge. She started to form a plan. Well, another plan. She had been forming plans to escape practically since the moment she had arrived.\nThe other feature of this hall in the Theme Park was its garden. The Collector was not only interested in animal organisms. Huge trees, ferns, flowering vines, mosses and more bizarre forms of vegetation grew over and around the tanks containing the exhibits—including Mantis. Those plants were her way out.\nFor a time, she had tried to use her telepathic powers to influence the Collector's cleaning and maintenance staff, or get one of the guards to open her tank. Then, she had tried to use her powers over plants to get them to grow over to her tank and break it apart with their roots. Neither worked, and Mantis realized the Collector had built this tank to dampen her active psionic powers.\nShe had another option to escape, but it would be an act of desperation—and if the Collector had blocked it as well, Mantis didn't want to know that just yet.\nAfter what felt like weeks, though, he forced her hand.\nHer tank was wheeled into a large arena, and placed inside a larger transparent chamber. The stands were packed with spectators, the noise from their minds nearly intolerable to Mantis, filled with eager bloodlust she couldn't shut out. She reached out, probing the barriers that imprisoned her and found that the Collector was still somehow blocking her telepathic powers.\nAnother tank came into the arena, and inside it was another Mantis. Even before their individual tanks dissolved and the Collector himself called out over the speaker system, Mantis understood what he wanted.\n\"You see I have another duplicate in my collections!\" he proclaimed. \"These infinite Mantises are intolerable! So again, my people, I have transformed this excess into entertainment. Two Mantises enter...one Mantis leaves!\"\nThe crowd exploded.\nThe other Mantis looked at her. How long had she been imprisoned here? Had she too tried to escape? Had anyone tried to rescue her? In this timeline, was she one of the Guardians of the Galaxy, or...? Mantis knew she would never know. She didn't have time to find out, and she felt the waves of anguish and desperation radiating from the other Mantis. There was no barrier between them. Mantis tried to calm her, but the frenzied crowd made that impossible. She steeled herself to fight, but then the other Mantis broke through.\nI can't do this anymore.\nMantis couldn't help her response: Two of us enter...\n...One leaves, the other finished. You. Then the Collector will have no Mantises, as it should be.\nWhat?\nThe mind of the other Mantis radiated an exhaustion and despair so intense Mantis almost tried to break off their connection. But she couldn't. One curse of being a telepath is you always felt like you owed someone your attention, since you spent so much time sneaking around in their mind. \nYou can go. You just have to leave your body behind. I'll help.\nNo, we can go together—\nWe can't. I don't have the strength. I can push you along a little, but I can't pull myself out of here. Too many battles...just too much...\nThe other Mantis' attention wavered, and Mantis realized she was only going to get one chance at this. She had to take it before the other Mantis faded away.\nGrateful for the other Mantis' sacrifice, Mantis gathered her mind and focused on the shimmering essence of the astral plane, unseen but omnipresent. She felt a tinge of remorse. She would miss this body...but she had missed all the others, too. Now was her chance. \nShe felt the other Mantis pouring energy into the link Mantis was building to the astral plane. The link would only hold for a short time before the Collector detected and severed it. Go, the other Mantis said. I can't do this for long.\n\"You win,\" Mantis told her other self — and with a sob, she let her body go. One Mantis leaves, she thought, and it was going to be her.\nDo me a favor, the other Mantis said as her consciousness faded away. Come back here sometime and pay the Collector a little visit.\nIn the astral plane, the Collector's Theme Park was a scintillating stew of thoughts and emotions, emanating from hundreds of different life forms. Mantis floated free of her enclosure and dove into a thicket of alien plant life, feeling the sensation of the vegetative consciousness enclosing her. She greeted the plants and made her request. In a rustle of leaves and a twitch of vines, they agreed.\nFrom the cells of vine and flower, branch and bark, Mantis built herself a new body and sank into it from the astral plane. It was a draining process but also a thrill, as she felt her physical self become real again. She thanked the plants and they rustled their acknowledgement. All right, Collector, she thought. Now we'll see what happens when one of your prize exhibits gets loose.\nWhen she stepped from the garden, fully formed and Mantis again, alarms were shrieking. She knew which way the hangar was, where huge spacecraft were docked, but she had something else to do first. \nAngling across the Collector's Museum, Mantis got close to her old enclosure. It stood empty, and across the gallery Sai stood in her own cage looked at Mantis. Didn't call out, didn't ask for help. Just looked.\nMantis ran to her cage, knowing she didn't have much time. The Collector's guards wouldn't be looking around here at first, but they would get around to it sooner or later. \"Your name is Sai, right?\"\nThe woman in the cage looked at her. \n\"You cut me out of your head,\" Mantis said. \"Would you like to get out of here? We might have to fight.\"\nSai smiled a smile as thin and deadly as her blades.\nAt that moment one of the Collector's guards lumbered around the corner and caught sight of Mantis. The guard, a massive humanoid with tusks and a clubbed tail, did a double-take, looking from her back to her tank—where her previous body lay in full view. \"Wha—\"\nThe guard never got a chance to finish. Mantis leapt into a spinning kick that snapped his head back, and before he could recover she had landed, kicked his legs out from under him, and landed an elbow in the middle of his forehead. When he hit the ground, she gave him a little telepathic encouragement to stay down. His agonized grimace turned into a sleepy, peaceful smile.\n\"Nice,\" Sai said as Mantis opened her cage. \"But not permanent.\"\n\"It just has to last until we're gone,\" Mantis said, already moving again.\n*\n\"Wait,\" Sai said when Mantis turned left toward another collection instead of right toward the hangar.\n\"There's someone else we have to get,\" Mantis.\n\"Who?\"\nMantis wasn't sure how to answer. \"Someone else I heard in my head,\" she said. \"His name is Jeff. He's...different.\"\n\"We don't have time,\" Sai said.\n\"I had time for you,\" Mantis said. \"I'm not leaving him here.\"\nSai held her gaze for a long moment, then rolled her eyes and gave up. \"Then let's make it fast.\"\nMantis was already moving, homing in on the unmistakable psionic sensation of Jeff's mind. She picked up the pace, dodging a patrol of the Collector's guards, and sensed that Jeff was just up ahead, in the —\n\"MMMRRRAAARRRR!!!!\"\nHe saw her and a huge grin spread over his face. A really huge grin. Filled with several rows of serrated teeth. \n\"...Jeff?\" Mantis couldn't quite believe it.\nHe bounded across the sand to the wall of his tank, which was kind of like a terrarium. What kind of creature was this? Mantis had seen sharks in her previous time on Earth, but this was a shark with...legs?\n\"MMMRRRAAARRRR!!!\"\n\"He's going to draw the guards,\" Sai said, her jaw tight. \nMantis smiled despite everything. They were on the run inside the Collector's Museum, with no idea how to get or where they would go if they did get off — yet there was something about Jeff that made her smile like she knew everything was going to be all right. \n\"Mmmrrrar?\" Jeff got quieter as he noticed the way Sai was looking at him.\n\"No, you're coming,\" Mantis said. \nShe broke the latch on his tank just as a detachment of guards came into view. They shouted and Mantis tried to reach out telepathically to divert them, but Sai was already there. Her blades flashed in a glittering dance, and the guards were down.\n\"Mrrrar,\" Jeff said appreciatively. Mantis got his tank open and he hopped out. \n\"Let's go,\" she said. She ran in the direction of the hangar, Sai at her side and Jeff bounding along right behind them.\n\"So, you wanted to know my real name, right?\" Sai said as they ran.\nMantis nodded. \"You're hiding your true self, even if you can't hide your emotions.\"\n\"Why does it matter to you?\"\nMantis stopped. \"I was curious. Also, for someone who just got sprung from the Collector's Museum, you sure are giving your rescuer a hard time. Would you rather go back?\"\n\"No,\" Sai said evenly. \"I just wanted to know what made us different.\"\nMantis pointed at Jeff. \"He made me believe it was possible, just because he's an optimist. And you, well...I knew you'd be someone I wanted on my side in a fight.\"\n\"Correct,\" Sai said. \"And it's Psylocke.\"\nMantis smiled and pointed. \"I like that. The hangar is this way. Let's get out of here.\"\nThey ran, and as they got to the access tunnel leading to the hangar they skidded around a corner and nearly ran into a pair of the Collector's guards. \n\"MRRRAAARRRR!!!\"\nJeff charged into action, jaws wide open as he leapt on the closest guard, who barely got an arm up to stop Jeff from chewing his face off. Mantis stunned the guard with a punch to the back of the neck and Jeff spun around to terrorize another guard, who backed away from him straight into the range of Sai's weapons. She dropped him without a sound.\n\"Come on,\" Mantis said, and they headed for the hangar.\n\"Do you know how to fly any of these ships?\" Sai asked.\n\"Some of them,\" Mantis said. \"The rest I'm sure I can figure out.\"\n\"Mrrrarrr!\" Jeff said, and Mantis felt like he was agreeing with her. \nTogether, they entered the hangar, and Mantis saw a likely ship. They were going to get out of here. \nThen she would find out how she'd gotten here, who was responsible.\nAnd when she knew that, she would come back here, to destroy the Theme Park and turn its exhibits on the Collector himself. Let him learn what it was like to be fodder for someone else's love of violence.\nSai was looking at her with a strange expression as Mantis fired up the control panel on their ship. \"What are you thinking?\"\n\"Oh, nothing,\" Mantis said. \"Jeff, you ready to get out of here?\"\n\"MMMRRRAAAARRRR!!!\"",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10230010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "After Quill went and crashed the Milano — because he wasn’t paying attention to what Rocket was telling him, naturally — Rocket had noted that they were in the middle of what looked like a huge ship graveyard. Great, he thought. Let me go find parts, get the Milano patched up, and we’ll be out of there in no time. \nSo that’s what he was doing, only most of the ships were so old that they didn’t have anything useful for the Milano. He’d marked a few that might be worth closer attention, but mostly Rocket was not finding what he needed in this massive junkyard. \n“Figures,” he said to nobody in particular. “Looks like I’m gonna have to engineer something tricky.”\nThere was movement among the hulks of ships off to his left. Rocket watched, but he didn’t see anything else. This Klyntar place had a strange vibe: Big spaceship boneyard, big monumental spooky ruins, all of it surrounded by a jungle made of the weirdest plants Rocket had seen on any planet. No visible sentient life, but all the same he felt like he was being watched. Also, there was a huge fire burning at one end of the boneyard, not too far from where Quill had crashed the Milano. Rocket considered checking back with the group before he explored much more...but nah. He could handle whatever came up. He sure didn’t need Quill, and Groot had said something about bonding with the local plants. Let him. Weirdo.\nUh oh. More movement. \nThey came out of the shadows so smoothly that for a moment, Rocket thought they were shadows. Then their motion gave them shape, silhouetted against the background of the spreading fire. Strange, elongated black life forms, no two the same except for their long teeth and claws. They sprang from the wrecked ships toward Rocket, but he didn’t waste any time. He racked his blaster and started shooting, running as he went. \nHe’d taken off in a more or less random direction, firing as he went to keep the monsters away, but ahead he saw a complex of buildings, in a weird monumental style that made him want to do literally anything other than go inside. But more and more of the toothy black monsters were hot on his tail, and Rocket prided himself on having better than average common sense, so he headed for the buildings, hoping to barricade a door, maybe. Anything to keep them out.\nRight before he got to the doorway, Rocket dropped a miniature gravity well behind him. He had been toying with black hole tech for a bit and the temporary void annihilated the closest monsters, buying him enough time to get inside the building and jam the door with various bits of debris — and a weird-looking statue he knocked over and shoved in front of the doorway. \nOkay, he thought. The monsters started to bang and scratch at the door. They weren’t getting in at the moment, but he wouldn’t have all day to execute the plan he hadn’t yet come up with.\nSo, he had to do a little scouting, see what he had to work with, but not waste any time. \nAs it turned out, quite a bit of scouting was required. Whoever had used these buildings, they had been very much into weapons and containment technology. This, Rocket reasoned, meant that it must have been some kind of jail, maybe? Or maybe they were trying to contain the living goo he had just escaped. Whatever its former use, he was going to turn it into a little fortress until such time as Groot and Quill decided to come looking for him. \nHis ears remained perked and alert, as he expected some of the monsters were in the building with him. This helped him dodge the blast from a wall turret as Rocket was trying to strip some quantum circuits out of a panel way down at the end of a long dark hall. He was so focused on what he was doing that he didn’t even hear the self-defense mechanism arm itself, only jumping backwards a moment before it fried him. He looked back to his score, a fresh new hole in the quantum circuit cluster he was attempting to pry out. “I was looting that!” Rocket shouted at the inanimate object. Only the turret wasn’t there anymore, smashed to bits by one of the creatures he was expecting.\nThe creature snarled back, and Rocket blew it away. In the darkness, he heard others moving and breathing. “Spooky,” he said. “Remind me not to book the reunion here.” He was talking just to hear his own voice, and keep himself calm while he figured out what to do. Truth was, only one course of action made sense. He couldn’t go back outside, so if he had to stay inside that meant getting rid of all the monsters, or activating the rest of the tech. \nRocket looked up and down the long corridor, noting how many side passages and intersections he could see. “Nah, too open.” He thought back to the building’s entrance. Just off the big front door, there was a smaller side room. It only had one door, and if he had oriented himself right, one of its walls was an exterior wall. So, if the monsters got in, he could always blast his way out through the wall. If he could retrofit the defense system before it took him out. \nNot the best plan in the world, but it would do for now.\nHe zig-zagged along the passages back to the front of the complex, slowed down a bit by all the gear he was dragging. A monster flashed out of a side passage, but Rocket had smelled it a split second before. Another one dropped from the ceiling, but Rocket’s whiskers sensed the disturbance in the air. Again, he was ready. His blaster lit up the darkened halls every time one of the monsters got near. The closest one of them got to him was a weird crab-looking version that ripped some hairs out of his tail before Rocket reduced it to a puddle of goo. \nThen he stopped in his tracks. Right there in a doorway was an energy barrier projector. Like the kind you might set up in a Xandarian prison. Rocket knew a little bit about those. \n“Aw yeah,” he said, ducking into the room and keeping his ears perked up while he fiddled with the barrier projector’s control panel. He was close to the entrance, close enough to hear the other monsters snarling outside the front door. This little room would be a perfect citadel, if he could get the other bits of the self-defense system online.\nOne of the monsters loomed out of the darkness. Rocket dropped his tools and blazed away at it until it was gone. Then he got back to work, knowing his time was running out. Kree, Shi’Ar, Skrull, Xandarian, so much tech had been retrofitted into this panel, Rocket was surprised it wasn’t his own invention. It looked like there wasn’t a power source but he had hotwired a few quantum circuits int his time. So he put the finishing touches into the console, paused to splatter another few monsters, and then hit the power button.\nAha! The energy barrier thrummed to life, with a few turrets in front of it, and because Rocket was exceedingly clever and also a little lucky, he was on the inside and the monsters were on the wrong end of a Kree turret. Just as an experiment, Rocket tried to shoot one of them through the barrier. Blam! It worked! \n“Aw, yeah,” he said again, louder this time, and then he was lighting them up through the barrier like there was no tomorrow. Which, if he didn’t figure out a way to get back to the Milano and get off this terrible monster rock, there wouldn’t be.\nHey, he thought. I bet I could use some of this stuff to reconstruct the containment fields in the Milano’s engines.\nThe idea lit up the inside of Rocket’s brain. He saw it all come together. It would totally work. All he had to do was get a plasma array, set of the couplings that would link it to the Milano’s magnetic field resonators, then wire the whole shebang into the acceleration chamber that was damaged when Quill crashed the Milano. Because, Rocket repeated in his mind, Quill was not listening to Rocket at the time. \nMore of the toothy black monsters that survived the turret onslaught threw themselves against the barrier. Rocket blazed away at them, and they fell back again. \nMan, he thought. This is a mighty elegant solution to a real tricky problem. Guess a few other unfortunate souls worked together to try and survive. But I guess whatever works... \nOnly problem was now, Rocket had to get out of the protected room, and the complex, with all the components.\nAnd that was going to require some finesse, because there were more of the monsters coming, and those doors weren’t going to hold forever. \nRocket racked a fresh charge into his gun, held it on the door, and waited.",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10240010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "From the throne atop her realm, the Queen of Hel recalled feeling the shattering of worlds, the sundering of realities as unknown forces knit them together again. Differently. She remembered venturing forth into her kingdom, only to discover that in Hel little had changed. However, Hela suspected once she traveled beyond her realm, she would see profound changes—and when she had worked enchantments to gaze upon worlds newly interwoven with the Ten Realms, her suspicions were confirmed. Mortals had done this? Remade time itself? Broken it and rewound different streams into a different braid or worlds? \nWhat power was this for men to wield? \nImmediately, Hela set about scheming a way to make it hers.\nFirst, she knew, she must understand Chronovium. One of her thralls, in life a great wizard-king, had brought to her a stone of a sort she had never seen before in Hel. She had paid it little mind until she grasped what the mortal Victor von Doom had done. Then, she sent the flock. Her crows scouted other realms, all returning bearing samples of Chronovium, the crystallized residue of the monstrous shocks to the space-time continuum. And yet, they all differed slightly from the version in Hel and from one another.\nWhoever learned best to control it, Hela knew, would rule worlds beyond Asgard. Beyond the Ten Realms. \nHela's intrigue deepened. New lands meant expanding the borders of Hel and welcoming vast numbers of new creatures into her ever-growing legions, perhaps even claiming the souls of the great beings known as Celestials. Only recently had she become aware of them, and then only through a new soul in Hel, cast there from another universe by the — what had he called it? — the Timestream Entanglement. This pitiful mortal, who met their end in the event, spilled forth knowledge of vast realms of space filled with fantastic creatures. \nAt a wave of her hand, Hela's crows feasted on the mortal's soul, her mind settling on a goal. The souls, and thus the power, of these great beings would belong to her. And when they did, she would sweep unchallenged through the Ten Realms, uniting them under the banner of Hel. Undoubtedly, Loki was hatching his own schemes to utilize Chronovium to increase his own power and ensure Asgard never slipped from his grasp, but Loki's schemes never worried Hela. Often, his petty obsessions and caprices benefited her by causing conflicts that added to her legions. At some point, she suspected, he would approach her proposing some sort of arrangement. Perhaps an alliance. Perhaps she would consent, and they would begin the dance of waiting for the right moment to betray each other. The joys of family.\nUntil then, she would proceed with her own plans, which led her to the current moment, as a messenger from a distant place she had never heard of before. Her initial response was to annihilate it for the arrogant crime of trespassing in her realm. However, it seemed to her that these disruptions of time and space could be a gift. Had it not opened vast new possibilities for Hel? Surely, she should learn what new worlds — new universes! — now lay within her grasp. \nSo, her crows stood perched while the otherworldly emissary trudged into her throne room.\nIt was a strange creature, appearing like blobs and tendrils of a tarry black substance bonded with a host. Its liquid flesh mingled aspects of its own nature and that of its host — currently a Jotun priestess. Even though she was no longer alive, enough of the Jotun's soul was still present for Hela to feel her horror at being bound to such a monstrosity. How curious.\nThe creature, however — the symbiote — had no such misgivings, or at least did not betray them. \n\"Tell me, little creature. What brings you to this place?\"\n\"You would do well to listen, Queen of Death,\" it said. \"I bring tidings from Knull, mighty lord of the abyss.\"\n\"And what is a 'Knull'? Is he the god of all creatures such as you?\" She made no effort to hide her scorn. This Knull was, in all likelihood, as debased and parasitic as its worshipper who stood before her.\n\"His power is eons older than yours, ancient before light existed, and he has his own claims on creatures whose essences he has consumed.\"\nAh, Hela thought. Of course. \"I take it he means to claim the Celestials as well?\"\nThe symbiote nodded and flicked out its tongue. \"Knull has learned that one of the Celestials is now in this realm. You cannot keep it, Asgardian. It is his to claim and it will be the key to his freedom.\"\n\"I cannot?\" Hela stood from her throne. \"Bold of you, parasite, to tell me what I can and cannot do in my own realm. What enters Hel is mine, forever. In fact,\" she said, giving the symbiote a closer look, \"perhaps I will even keep you. What manner of soul does a creature like you possess?\"\nThe symbiote remained still. Hela let it wonder for quite a while, as she pondered what she had already learned. The key to his freedom, the emissary had said. So, this Knull was a god in chains, yet he still possessed the reach to send a message to Hel. He knew the power of Celestials. He knew that the tangled worlds had brought new souls into Hel. \nTherefore, there must now be a way from Hel to… \"What is the world you come from, creature?\"\n\"Klyntar, O Queen.\"\nA name she knew vaguely. People from a culture long since annihilated had once come to her realm from there. She considered a little longer. \n\"I release you,\" she said. \"Now, release your host.\"\nThe symbiote did, peeling and secreting and withdrawing from the skeletal form of the Jotun priestess. \"Return to your master,\" Hela went on, \"and tell him that he may rule Klyntar, but Hela rules Hel. And if he wishes to fight me…\" she smiled. \"Then he too will become one of my subjects. Do you have that, messenger?\"\nThe symbiote mass quivered, but without a host it could not speak. Hela worked a spell, drawing forth knowledge from its mind. She swirled open a gateway to a world of darkness, an impenetrable jungle where no sane mortal would tread. \"Go,\" Hela said, \"before I change my mind.\"\nThe symbiote sprang through the gateway and was gone. Hela let the gateway close. Now, Knull knew that she could reach out to his world directly. Let him think on that and consider his next move. \nHela gathered up a mass of Chronovium, imbued with the essence of Hel. Just as all lives must end, she reflected, all things must move through time. Did it not follow that all time ended in Hel as well? And did it not follow that Hel could grow through this crystallized time, encompassing new realms brought near by the entanglement of worlds? \nThe Hel-Chronovium was shot through with black and green. She spoke to it, shaping it into an enchantment, the first of many. \"All living beings,\" she said, \"in all realms, in all universes. They shall be thralls of Hel. They need not come to me. I will use you, Chronovium, to expand Hel not through space but through time. Beings more ancient than stars will be mine, and beings not yet born will be mine. This is a powerful magic and will take some time to work. But it shall be done, and then Knull?\" She smiled. \"He will be mine as well.\"\nShe suspected that the symbiote emissary was not Knull's only gambit. Doubtless he was plotting against her, seeking ways to undermine her and the reach of Hel. Let him, she thought. Let him beguile mortals and persuade greedy gods that they can band together against me. That would bring them all the closer — and as she had already told the symbiote emissary, whatever entered Hel was Hela's. Unless she chose to let it go.\nAnd soon, souls would no longer come to Hel, Hel would come to them. Her realm would grow outward through time, drawing in numberless souls until she had an army so vast not even gods could hope to resist it. The Ten Realms were just the beginning.\nShe spun the black and green Chronovium jewel over her palm. \"Yield to me your secrets,\" she commanded. \"Bring to me the future, as I already rule the past.\"",

He knew this meant he was not yet meant to hear what they had to say. The Orisha would not be hurried, though the times demanded action. In particular, the Timestream Entanglement demanded action. The two Dooms, megalomaniacs from their two different histories, were at war, and all the different worlds were their battlefield—including the worlds of the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. T'Challa had built this empire over the course of his life, bringing peoples and planets into the fold and protecting them from all threats. The Wakandan ideal — progress and tradition intertwined, science and magic woven together into a purely technomantic culture — was the pillar of the empire, and T'Challa did his best to embody both. Both Dooms had tried to enlist him in their battles, arguing that Wakanda and Latveria were more alike than different. T'Challa responded coldly, disliking the Dooms' shared presumption that like them, T'Challa wished to be a tyrant. \"You have a chance,\" the Doom from times past spoke, \"not only to control the future but to choose which future you would control.\" Conversely, the Doom of 2099 argued, the Timestream Entanglement created not one future to choose, but an infinite panoply to be ruled simultaneously. \"Now,\" he claimed, \"we can create an endless gallery of futures, all of which may fall under our control.\" \nT'Challa knew better than to trust either ruler, so he delayed allying with either Doom, knowing sooner or later he must choose, but also dreading the disastrous potential of an ill-informed choice. Nevertheless, the decision loomed. Wakanda could not remain neutral when so much was at stake. Could the Empire oppose both Dooms? What effect would that have, if there was no way to undo the Timestream Entanglement, or at least stabilize it to prevent more cataclysms? \nToo many questions, all of which the Orisha refused to answer.\nWhat disturbed him the most about the Timestream Entanglement was that it meant he could be certain of nothing. He did not know whether he had existed a year ago, whether the Empire had existed a year ago. He did not trust his own mind, and the more he retired to the Hall of the Orisha, the more keenly he felt the need for their voices. \nThey were not always silent, but they were always unclear. T'Challa would almost have preferred the repudiation of their silence. At least that would have told him he was wrong. As it was...\nHe knew Shuri was there before she spoke, softly, in deference to the sacred surroundings. \"Brother.\"\n\"Sister.\" T'Challa and Shuri had not agreed on much these past weeks. He let the greeting hang. She had come to see him, so she could tell him why.\n\"You are spending a lot of time alone in this hall,\" she said eventually. \"What for?\"\n\"Waiting for guidance,\" he said.\n\"Your people are waiting for you to guide them,\" Shuri retorted. \"We know what to do. The data is clear.\"\n\"Data does not tell the whole story, sister,\" T'Challa said. \n\"It tells enough. We know the Doom of 2099 did not cause this. He wishes to turn it to his own ends, but he did not cause it. So our choice is clear!\" To Shuri, this was self-evident: Their true opponent was the Doom who had caused the Timestream Entanglement.\nT'Challa wasn't so sure. \"Is it? We who exist in a nexus of futures, knit together by faster-than-light travel and teleportation devices — we should cast our lot with the Doom who now wishes to master all those futures?\"\n\"Better him than the Doom who would keep the worlds churning and annihilating each other. Sooner or later, the disciple of chaos is consumed by chaos.\"\nNow T'Challa couldn't help but smile. \"That's philosophical, coming from you. The Orisha speak to you too, whether you think you hear them or not.\"\n\"Brother,\" she said, coming closer to him and holding his gaze as she took one of his hands in both of hers. \"You're not the only one who cares about tradition. If the Orisha speak, I will also hear what they have to say. But if they do not, we still must act. You still must act. Even without the Bast's direction, you are still the Black Panther, our king and leader. You will make the right decision.\"\n\"I do not share your confidence.\" He could not have admitted that to anyone else, but Shuri was his sister and his closest confidant. T'Challa could permit himself to be vulnerable around her. \nAnd she him. \"You and I both understand how deeply the Timestream Entanglement has destabilized space-time in every direction,\" Shuri said. \"How do we know what it has done to us, to our memories? How do you know we were not versions of ourselves created by the Entanglement?\"\nThis problem, which had so unsettled T'Challa just minutes before, had melted away, and he didn't know why until he was articulating his response. \"Because the Orisha are still speaking.\" It felt true as he said it. T'Challa took comfort in their voices, but also knew that their message was not meant to comfort. Wakanda faced a terrible choice, and only he could make it — but he could not make it without his sister's counsel.\n\"Then listen to them,\" Shuri said. She tapped a miniature console on her wrist and a holographic screen appeared in front of them. \"And listen to me.\"\nThe screen lit up with an image T'Challa had seen too many times. Doombots of 2099 dropping out of the sky, spreading destruction across a city he recognized. A futuristic version of San Francisco. The span of the Golden Gate Bridge shattered, the rolling hills veiled in smoke, panicked tourists fleeing as museums and monuments collapsed around them. \nThe same scene repeated in the Wakandan provincial planet Eta Ophiuchi IV. \nAnd in the Savage Land.\nAnd in Madripoor.\n\"Those are not the same Doombots,\" T'Challa observed.\n\"There is no difference between the Dooms,\" Shuri said. \"They want only power, and they know only one way to get it.\"\nDoombots battled on the rooftop of the Baxter Building...and then a different Baxter Building, this one partially collapsed.\nDoombots streaking around a Helicarrier like hornets. The Helicarrier burning, its engines failing as it fell toward the ocean far below.\nT'Challa did not permit himself to turn away. The Orisha murmured, their voices mostly just beyond his hearing. If even they were uncertain, how was he to choose? \nHe didn't realize he had spoken aloud until Shuri answered him.\n\"Because that,\" she said, \"is what kings do.\"\nT'Challa nodded gravely. \"And on the king's head rest the consequences of those decisions. They are not to be made rashly.\"\n\"Brother. What is in this Empire's best interest? Do we confront this threat or permit it to grow? That is the question.\"\n\"Yes. And making a decision without having the necessary information has led many an empire to ruin.\"\nThey kept watching Doom's reign of terror over every place his Doombots could reach. Shuri gave T'Challa another minute to think, and then she asked, \"So what are we to do?\"\n\"Did you put this video together?\"\n\"I will not lie to you, brother. Certain people asked me to speak to you.\" Off his accusatory look, she protested, \"But I would have done it anyway.\"\n\"Who?\"\n\"Tony Stark. Reed Richards.\"\nOf course, T'Challa thought.\n\"We need to band together to fight back,\" Shuri pressed, \"and it isn't about one Doom or another. It is about rebuilding a future we can all live in.\"\nTiny Shuri, standing so resolute. T'Challa admired her more than he could say. Certainly more than he could tell her or she would never let him hear the end of it. He broke into a smile. \"Sister, you do have your ways.\"\n\"My ways work.\"\nHis smile faded. \"No. Wakanda does not need Reed Richards and Tony Stark to tell it what to do.\"\n\"You mean you don't want that. Don't mistake yourself for the empire, brother.\"\nT'Challa's expression hardened as the video feed continued to show the destruction of Madripoor—another Madripoor. \"I hear your advice, sister. And you would do well to heed mine: Do not be so quick to abandon the old ways to please outsiders. Their interest is not Wakanda's interest.\"\nThe rebuke stung her. To soften the blow, T'Challa decided to give her some of what she wanted. A leader must know when to stand firm and when to compromise. \n\"Work with Stark and Richards if you wish,\" he said. \"They are trying to develop a machine to undo what Doom has done, yes?\"\nShe nodded, still too angry to speak to him.\n\"Lend your mind to this cause, and with it, Wakanda's technological prowess.\" He put a hand on her shoulder. \"Lead them, sister.\"\nThough Shuri tried, she couldn't quite hide a mischievous smile. \"Oh, they need to be led, all right. Think they know everything.\"\n\"Then you will show them, will you not?\"\n\"I will,\" Shuri promised. \"But surely there is more we can do, brother. People are in need. Across numberless worlds, the Dooms stomp out all dissent.\"\n\"The Orisha will guide us when it is time,\" T'Challa said. Having compromised already, he was not inclined to give in further. \"Go, Shuri. Build the machine. When it is time for Wakanda's armies to join the battle, Bast will show the way.\"\n\"I wish I trusted them as you do,\" Shuri said, her gaze wandering over the statues of the Orisha in the great hall.\n\"I wish that as well,\" T'Challa said.\nAfter she left, he returned to his deep listening. What he hadn't mentioned to Shuri, lest it fuel her skepticism toward the Orisha, was that their voices sounded...different. Even now, as Bast spoke to him, telling him he had done well to keep Wakanda out of the battle between the Dooms, that a time was coming for Wakanda to commit but that time was not yet at hand...there was something strange about her voice. Had the annihilation of so many timelines transformed the very Orisha themselves? Or was another force at work, bending their voices before he could perceive them?\nTroubled, T'Challa held his station, waiting for a true sign from the Orisha, one unquestionable in their wisdom and understanding. But until then, he stood resolute in the knowledge that if there was to be war, Wakanda would determine the victor. For the Panther was poised to strike.",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10270010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "When the Milano crashed, Groot stood around for a while watching Rocket and Quill argue about whose fault it was, but pretty soon he got distracted by the voices he was hearing from the jungle surrounding the ship graveyard. The vines and trees and flowers all had voices, but Groot was far enough away that he couldn't tell what they were saying. Eventually, Rocket and Quill got on his nerves enough that he had to get away from them, so he went for a walk. As he walked away, he heard Rocket say, \"See? Even Groot can't take your crap, Quill. I'm gonna go find a way out of here while you sit here and pretend you know how to fix the ship!\" He heard Rocket stomping away in another direction, but Groot didn't try to meet up with him. Rocket needed time by himself sometimes, and so did Groot. Especially on strange planets that stank of death.\nThe ship had come down near one end of the graveyard containing... hundreds of other ships? Maybe more? Groot wasn't good at counting. He wandered away from the fire that burned in the Milano's crash path, finding himself at the edge of the jungle. The voices of the jungle spoke to him, and Groot stopped and stood still, trying hard to listen now that he was close enough to understand what they were saying.\nAway get away we'll hurt you if you get close\nA chill ran down Groot's branches, straight into his roots. He had never heard plants talk like this. He stayed still, letting his consciousness drift out and collect impressions like a pollinator floating from flower to flower. \nHurt you hunger survival death prison Klyntar\nHey, Groot thought to them. You don't have to be afraid.\nYou don't belong here\n\"I am Groot,\" Groot said. He looked at the edge of the jungle, where it tumbled over the hulks of wrecked ships, grew among them and over them, strove to reclaim them and make it as if they were never there. These were not plants like he had ever encountered. They were part plant and part...something else. Something from Klyntar, made of Klyntar. Beings of some kind, that could only exist when they bonded to something else, creating a new being that was part host and part parasite. Groot was horrified and fascinated. \nI'm new here, Groot thought. \nGo away go back where you came from \nIt's all right, Groot emanated peace and kindness. I am Groot.\nNone of them had names. They conferred among themselves, snapped at each other, screamed and wailed and whispered in pheromonal registers only they and Groot could understand. They were still afraid. Even more, they were confused by how friendly Groot was. He could feel that in their responses. It was like nobody had ever been friendly to them before. \nThis planet must be a hard place to live, Groot communed.\nThat idea confused them too, because it had never occurred to any of them that it was possible to live somewhere else.\nOh yes, friends, Groot expressed. I've been to dozens of other worlds. This one is... He struggled to find a thought that was honest without being hurtful. Tough, he thought. Not too friendly.\nWhat is friendly?\nWow, Groot thought. So that's what he was dealing with. \nHe tried to project a feeling of openness. Trust, feeling understood, and knowing you were never alone, surrounded by the people important to you.\nThe jungle plants were still confused...but now they were also curious. Weakness was whispered back to Groot.\nNo, Groot said. Trust takes strength.\nThey considered this. He could feel their conflicting reactions, and Groot could not help but be astonished that none of the jungle plants had ever considered what was trust. It was so fundamental to his relationship with Rocket, and Quill, and the other Guardians...\nHeat seared his branches as a huge explosion bloomed over the junkyard. Groot flinched away from it, stepping into the jungle, and turned to look from the relative safety of the tangled vines and underbrush.\nThe fire caused by the Milano's crash had spread, and finally found another ship with a reserve of fuel or ammunition. The mushroom cloud of the explosion still spread over Klyntar's black sky, and the fire was now racing across the graveyard.\nToward the jungle.\nPanic and fear spread among the plants. Groot felt fear too, partly for them and partly for himself. Fire was any plant's worst enemy, worse even than drought. At least in a drought, you could hope for rain. \nAlso, Groot could move. These plants...they might be part symbiote, but by and large they were still rooted to their spots. \nThat meant Groot had to help them. \nHe saw the fire approaching, licking along the lines of the crashed ship toward the edges of the graveyard, where the jungle had begun to reclaim the wrecks. Already some plants were charred and curled by the sweeping flames. Groot saw those crinkling leaves, those wilting flowers — and he got angry. \nIn his anger he grew. Thousands of feet of roots dug into Klyntar's soil, spreading along the boundary of the jungle. Groot forced them out, felt them searching for nourishment and finding little, but still he grew them, until he had created an intertwined mat of roots under the soil, overlapping the edge of the jungle and the outermost crashed spaceships.\nThen, he closed his eyes and lifted them up. The earth heaved under those ships, toppling them over away from the jungle with a gargantuan sound of tearing roots and shifting earth. The pain of tearing the plant life from himself was nothing compared to the satisfaction Groot felt when the wall of roots and wrecked spaceships collapsed on the fire, suffocating it immediately where it had been threatening the jungle. Even those few embers that remained would have had to cross a firebreak fifty yards across to reach the jungle. \nGroot let the roots die off into the earth. He stood silently for a moment, recovering his strength as the fire sputtered and crackled among the jumbled wreckage. He was happy. Even better, he heard the voices of the jungle and he could tell that his new plant friends were grateful.\nGroot save us Groot go save other friend, one of them said.\nWhat? Which friend? Groot looked back over the ship graveyard. The area around the Milano was still unburned, so unless Quill had gone wandering he was fine. \nThat left Rocket. \nOne of the plants — a woody vine with entangled mouths from some other species that was intermingled with it — volunteered that it had seen a smallish mammal headed in the direction of the old complex of buildings.\nGroot didn't know where that was. The vine rustled, and tensed some of its tendrils. They pointed in a certain direction. When Groot looked that way, he saw two things. One, the fire had spread not just to the edge of the jungle but a complex of buildings he had somehow missed.\nRocket is in there?\nThe vine coiled in a shrugging motion. That way.\nGroot thanked the vine and charged across the ship graveyard, giving the fire a wide berth and arriving at a corner of the building complex just as one side of it was catching fire. He punched through a wall on the other side. \"I am Groot!\" he roared over the sound of the fire.\n\"Groot, you idiot! What took you so long? You think I'm in here for my health?\"\nRocket was alive! Groot charged into the building toward the sound of Rocket's voice. Halfway there, he ran straight into a group of tentacled black monsters. They were trying to get at Rocket, who was stuck inside a room with some kind of energy barrier blocking its doorway with turrets ripped out of the walls, strewn upon the floor. \n\"I AM GROOT!\" he roared, tearing the monsters apart. More came from the darkened halls and rooms. Groot tore them to pieces too, but there were still more, and still more. He knew he might not make it to Rocket, but that wasn't going to stop him from trying. Their fangs and claws stung his bark and tore at his roots. Groot roared and fought back. He heard Rocket calling his name, but he couldn't spare the focus to answer. All he could do at that moment was stay alive as the black monsters overran him.\nThen help came from an unexpected source. Vines twisted out of the darkness, ensnaring the monsters and dragging them away. We help! the vine called to Groot. \n\"I am Groot!\" he shouted back, glad to see his new friends — and also feeling proud that on this planet where every plant was suspicious and hostile, he had helped them learn how to be friends. \n\"Who are you talking to? I'm over here!\" Rocket shouted.\n\"I am Groot!\"\n\"What do you mean, it's hard to explain?\"\nGroot didn't try to elaborate. He fought through the remaining symbiotes to reach Rocket, who was hunkered down in a small room with an energy barrier across the door.\n\"I am Groot.\"\n\"Yeah, I know.\" Rocket turned off the energy barrier. \"How did you know I was here?\"\nGroot turned and pointed at the vine, which was twisting its way back along the corridor toward the hole Groot had punched through the building. \"I am Groot.\"\n\"Groot, you moron! You trusted a symbiote vine to tell you how to help me escape from other symbiotes?\"\nGroot looked at Rocket. \"I am Groot.\"\n\"I know it worked! Still...\" Rocket gave up. \"Whatever. Anyway, Quill needs help way worse than I do. Come on, we gotta get back to the Milano before the symbiotes remember he's there.\" Rocket powered the energy barrier down and started detaching it from its fixtures in the doorframe. \"Here, you gotta carry this. I'm gonna use it to fix the ship.\" He chuckled to himself. \"Quill's gonna feel so dumb when I show him this trick. I love it.\"\nGroot picked up the energy barrier projection frame and started back toward the Milano. The voices of Klyntar's plants were still in his head. He felt proud of himself for what the vine had done, not because Groot could take credit for it, but because he had helped the vine see what it could do on its own, just by being friendly. \nHe didn't tell Rocket any of this. Rocket wouldn't understand.",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10290010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "The flames rose high in the netherworld known as Limbo, and the sinister demons who dwelled in the accursed realm bowed in reverence. After all, it wasn't every day that two of the most powerful magicians in the Multiverse graced this dimension with their presence.\nWanda Maximoff may have been the Sorceress Supreme in her home reality, but despite her power and status, she was merely an honored guest. For in Limbo, none were as powerful or respected as the queen of the realm — Illyana Rasputin, the Mutant known as Magik. \nMagik had recently returned from the battlefront of a timeline-spanning war against malevolent gods and demons that showed no signs of stopping. Limbo may have been no more than a scorched wasteland, but she had to admit, she was glad to be home. At least until the moment a portal opened and Wanda walked through. Because, in any reality, when the Scarlet Witch turned her eyes upon Mutants, there was no predicting what might happen next. \n\"What brings you to my kingdom, Witch?\" Magik asked, her Russian accent sharpening her every word like tiny daggers. It was clear she was not thrilled to be called upon during her brief moment of respite. Illyana's cold gaze would likely have sent a chill down the spine of even the fieriest of her subjects. But Wanda Maximoff had seen far worse in her time defending her own collapsing reality and remained undeterred. \n\"I have come to gather allies for a great war beyond the ones here,\" responded Wanda.\n\"I already have plenty of allies,\" Magik said with a smile, motioning to the horde of demons kneeling nearby, awaiting her command. \"And as for wars, are we not already facing too many here?\" \n\"None like this,\" Wanda said. \"Countless timestreams have become entangled. At first I thought it was merely my own dimension that was in peril, but Stephen showed me otherwise.\"\n\"Stephen…?\" Magik paused. It had been ages since she had heard that name. Could it be that her former mentor in the mystic arts, Doctor Strange, was still alive? \n\"Yes,\" said Wanda. \"Doctor Strange showed me that there are battles on the horizon far greater than any I could have comprehended.\"\n\"I can hardly imagine a conflict bigger than the one I've been facing,\" mused Magik. \"But Stephen always taught me that the problems I can see are often meant to distract from the ones I can't.\"\n\"Indeed,\" Wanda concurred. \"We have all become so embroiled in our own conflicts that we have been missing the bigger picture.\" \nWith that, the Scarlet Witch opened her palm and conjured up a swirl of red chaos magic. Inside the frenzied wisps of energy, an image coalesced, showing the greatest heroes from every reality clashing against one another.\n\"That… doesn't look good at all,\" Magik said, her confident smirk disappearing from her face for the first time since this meeting of mighty mystics began. \"But if Stephen has you on his side, why would he need me? Clearly, your skills as a sorceress far surpass my own.\" \n\"I deal in chaos magic,\" Wanda replied. \"But you… your magic taps into the soul. And when so many souls across so many dimensions are in peril, that kind of power may be just what we need.\" \n\"True, the soul is a powerful thing…\" Magik said, as she reached her arm out to her side, clenching her hand into a fist. Within her grip, the hilt of a sword began to materialize, manifesting from energy drawn directly from Illyana's own essence. As the sword's blade — longer and wider than a young woman her size should have been able to comfortably wield — took form, Illyana raised it to point directly at the Scarlet Witch's throat. \n\"…but even a soul as pure as a snowflake can be corrupted.\" In a burst of hellfire, Magik herself began to transform. A pair of twisted horns emerged from her forehead as a pointed tail slithered out from the base of her spine. As eldritch armor wrapped her now demonic figure, Illyana gave a wicked smile that exposed her freshly-sharpened fangs. The denizens of Limbo hollered as their queen took her most majestic form, leaving Magik behind to become the Darkchild.\nWanda paused for a moment, wondering if perhaps she should have called upon a different version of Magik from another reality instead. One who had not yet fully embraced her place on Limbo's throne. But as she considered her next move, an unexpected voice broke the tense moment. \n\"Put down the sword, darlin',\" the gruff voice said. \"Wanda ain't lyin'. Not this time, at least. We're all on the same side here. And I don't care how big those horns of yours are these days…\"\nThrough the towering spires of flame stepped a Mutant that Illyana knew well — the man called Logan. The Wolverine. \n\"…you'll always be that little girl I used to know.\"\nIt was clear that the creatures of Limbo knew Wolverine as well. Mere moments before, they had been building to a frenzy as they cheered their demon queen towards wanton violence. Now, their silence was tangible as they quaked with fear. \nLogan's claws were fully extended, already dripping with the blood of demons foolish enough to stand in his way. They may have been her loyal subjects, but Magik felt no remorse for those who had fallen at Logan's hand. They should have known better than to cross his path. \n\"Logan? What brings you to this place?\" Wanda inquired. \n\"Search and rescue mission,\" Logan replied. \"We've been gatherin' lost Mutants. Bringin' 'em back home to Krakoa. In case ya didn't notice, the timestream is a bit of a mess. Krakoa's one of the few places that's still safe, in any timeline. At least for the moment.\"  \n\"I hate to disappoint,\" Magik said, \"but I am not in need of sanctuary. I have things under control.\"\n\"Uh huh. Sure ya do, sweetheart,\" Wolverine replied, his sarcasm palpable. \"But I never said I came to get you.\"\n\"Then who?\" asked Wanda curiously.\n\"Just a kid,\" Wolverine said. \"Doesn't even have a codename yet. But she does have some sorta dimensional warpin' ability. Made a portal and got sucked into it. Lucky for her, the thing stayed open just long enough for me to jump through after her.\" \n\"She's probably terrified being lost in a realm like this,\" Wanda said. \"Imagine the trauma…\"\n\"I don't have to imagine it,\" mused Magik. \"I lived it myself. And I won't let another Mutant go through what I did. Follow me.\"\nAs Magik began to run, her Darkchild form receded, and her true self took control once more.\n\"Shouldn't I be the one in the lead, darlin'?\" asked Wolverine. \"I'm the expert tracker here.\"\n\"And I am the queen of this dimension,\" replied Magik. \"You will always have my respect, Logan… but in this place, I am in charge. Now, be a good boy and try not to disembowel any more of my subjects along the way, would you?\" \n\"No promises,\" Wolverine muttered under his breath as the three heroes rushed across the rocky, fire strewn landscape in search of the missing Mutant. Although they each came to this place for different reasons, the queen, the witch, and the hunter, all managed to set aside their personal desires to serve the needs of one missing child. There was no doubt that, despite hailing from disparate realities, they all shared the same heroic spirit. \n\"I can sense her presence, just ahead,\" Wanda said as they reached the mouth of a small cave. \"Reality is bending around her. But a simple hex can set that right…\"\nThe Scarlet Witch moved her hands like an expert surgeon, weaving a complex spell to stabilize time and space. But chaos magic is not always predictable, and while reality itself may have stopped shifting, the rocks surrounding the cave's mouth had suddenly become dangerously displaced. \n\"Rockslide!\" barked Logan as he raced forward, towards the hole in the cliff wall. But he was a split second too late. Debris blocked his path, and his efforts to slash through the dense boulders with his Adamantium claws yielded little progress. \nUndeterred, the Queen of Limbo stepped forward towards the pile of rubble, casually opening a small circle in the sky in front of her with her own Mutant power. These stepping discs, as she called them, usually allowed her to traverse across distances and dimensions. This time, however, it provided a safe exit for a very frightened young girl.\n\"Nothin' to worry about now, kiddo,\" Logan said as the young Mutant child wrapped her arms around her hero tightly. \"I'll get ya home, safe and sound.\"\n\"How will you do that?\" asked Magik. \"Her powers are too unpredictable. And, to be honest, my stepping discs haven't been much better for cross-dimensional travel since the timestream got turned upside down.\"\n\"This old dog's got a few new tricks,\" Logan grinned. He silently knelt down, pulling a small seed from one of the pouches on his belt. Popping a single claw to carve a hole in Limbo's rocky soil, he planted the seed in the ground — and within moments it began to sprout. A vine took form, growing and twisting into a shape that resembled a large doorway. Once the vine began to flower, the open, empty space it had encircled began to crackle with a strange energy. And suddenly, the flames of Limbo were no longer visible on the other side, but rather, the sun-kissed shores of the Mutant island Krakoa. \n\"Well,\" Logan said as he took his young ward by the hand and glanced back at Magik, \"you comin' or not, Rasputin?\" \nMagik hesitated for a moment. She wished to witness firsthand the safe haven for her people that her old friend had spoken of. Yet she still had a war to fight in another dimension. And, more importantly, a critical discussion to finish with the Scarlet Witch. But perhaps this was the very opportunity that Wanda had spoken of. A chance to bring together a mix of forces from across realities to combat the dangers ahead. A chance to make a new kind of magic together. Not magic born from chaos or even from the soul… but from the heart. \n\"I will join you,\" Magik finally replied. \"But only if Wanda can come as well.\"\n\"Sorry,\" Wolverine responded, \"but Krakoa only lets Mutants pass through its gates. And last I checked, Wanda here was only Mutant-adjacent.\"\n\"Nothing a little chaos magic can't fix,\" Wanda said with a smile. With a gentle touch, the arcane energy of a hex danced across the organic outer edge of the Krakoan gateway. The white flowers on the vine turned to a deep crimson, surely a sign that Wanda was now welcome to pass through. \n\"You want chaos, Wanda?\" muttered Wolverine as he led his new friends through the portal. \"Just wait 'til Magneto gets a look at you…\"",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10310010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "High summer on the beach was a great time to be alive anywhere. It was even better when you were on the gem of the Pacific, Jeju Island. And it was way better when you were on Jeju Island singing in front of a hundred thousand screaming fans against the backdrop of the deep blue sea and a cloudless sky. \nLuna Snow soaked it all in as she closed the fifth song of her set, \"Flow,\" hearing the fireworks go off behind her right on schedule as her last line — Finally now we feel alive! — drove the crowd into an even bigger frenzy. Whoa, they're extra loud, she thought. Not just the crowd, but the fireworks even more so, loud enough to shake the stage. Some gear fell over in the wings. She glanced at the crew, keeping her show smile big. It looked like they had things under control, but they were also looking around like —\nWhoa again. The ground really shook that time, and it wasn't any kind of stage effect she and her choreographers had programmed into the set. \nA split second later, she saw it among the fans, a surge of fear passing through the crowd as they all felt the shaking and turned to face the sea.\nThen Luna saw it too.\nThe horizon moved. A slow bulge at first, but as it approached, it grew into a great wave surging in the direction of the beachside amphitheater. A tsunami! But no ordinary tsunami, because behind it — no, within it — lurked an immense shadow, as if the wave had not arisen naturally but was being driven by something below. How big would a creature have to be to cause a wave of this size? Already the water was draining away from the shore. That meant she had very little time to act. \nSo act she did, springing off the stage and rushing toward the beach as the crowd scattered away. The wave was growing with no signs of stopping. She planted her feet when she reached the coastline and called up every atom of her cryokinetic powers. Singing a high, wordless note, she found the frequency of the waves and tuned herself to it, feeling the power flow from her, through the wet sand at her feet and out into the base of the immense wave. Dark ice shot up from the exposed seabed, threading up through the wave and spreading until the entire tsunami was frozen in place. Even though less than a minute had passed since she had left the stage, Luna had managed to calm the seas for a moment.\nAnd a long moment it was, the only sounds along the beach being the astonished gasps and sobs of the audience. \nThen cracks began to appear.\nSomething was moving within the ice. The shadow, she thought — and just as the thought formed in her head, the frozen standing wavefront shattered.\nThe momentum of the tsunami was broken, so its towering water flowed across the shore and back into the sea, but what emerged amid the battleship-sized shards of ice made Luna realize that she had solved the symptom, not the cause.\nThe monster was perhaps a hundred meters tall, octopus-like, with tentacles that lashed out over the water as it churned through the shallows toward the shore. Toward her fans. Its body was weirdly translucent, bizarre organs glowing within its massive form. In its eyes was pure, mindless rage. She had heard suspenseful tales of this creature, but never thought it was real: the menace from the murky depths, Monstro.\nAs the beast arose from the sea, she saw something else: A jagged wound in the side of its body, where the tentacles all gathered. \nNo wonder it's so mad, that cut is huge! she thought as she skated towards the base of one tentacle, just below the corner of its eye. This creature was most definitely enraged by the agony of its wound. If it got to the shore, a lot of people would not be making it home from the island.\nBut she wasn't going to let that happen. \n\"Hey, hey, Monstro,\" she crooned, taking a step forward as Monstro's tentacles churned the shallows into foam that swirled around her feet. One of its tentacles slashed through the air just over her head. If she got too close, or didn't get close enough, all the people watching from the amphitheater and via streams all over the world were going to see the end of Luna Snow...and who knew how many other people. \nSo she focused on what she could do. She channeled her powers, the light ice she had learned how to wield as the other aspect of her cryokinesis blooming where her fingertips touched the churning surf. She reached out, and the water around Monstro's body transformed into curling veins of warm healing ice. They crept up, finding the wound and tracing its length. Luna trembled with the effort of healing the wound—it was so much larger than anything she had ever tried to heal before. Behind her, she dimly heard a new sound rushing through the crowd, but whether it was fear or excitement or anticipation she couldn't tell without losing her focus, and if she lost her focus now, much more would also be lost. Little by little, her healing ice grew filaments across the wound, one side reaching toward the other. Monstro grew still, as if it knew what she was trying to do...or was biding its time until she failed. \nThere! The ice linked up across the bleeding gap, knit it together again, then melted into Monstro's skin. Its tentacles fell limp for a long moment, as if in relief, like that was Monstro's way of letting out a long sigh. Then, slowly and peacefully, it slipped back out into deeper water and was gone, leaving the huge chunks of ice to crash and grind against each other in its wake.\nThen Luna heard a voice off to her right. \"Surface dweller. So-called superstar. Luna Snow.\"\nShe turned, and barely suppressed a squeak of shock. Hovering above her on winged feet was none other than Namor, ruler of Talocan and all the endless expanse of the deep ocean. And apparently, he wanted to talk to her? Luna was a little starstruck, which didn't happen to her often, but she kept her wits about her enough to make sure that her mic was still live. \n\"Your...Majesty?\" she said. \"Welcome to Jeju Island.\"\n\"You need not welcome me to what I am about to possess,\" Namor said. \"Talocan shall soon rule this island, and all surface dwellers who venture here will kneel before me.\"\n\"I don't know about that, Your Majesty,\" Luna said as she rode her ice into the sky to look him in the eye. \"At the moment, I think it's pretty clear that I rule Jeju Island. I mean, look at this crowd!\"\n The remaining crowd burst into loud cheers at this, and Luna let Namor soak in it for a moment. He might have been a Mutant king, but she was Luna Snow, and nobody was going to bully her in front of a million fans.\n\"Careful, human,\" Namor said. \"I came here to give you my thanks. And while I admire your courage, if you show me any more disrespect, I promise that your song will be cut short.\"\n\"Oh. Um.\" Luna gave a little chuckle, relying on cuteness to buy her some time. \"Well, in that case, you're welcome? And what are you thanking me for?\" She looked around at the mess the melting ice was causing all along the shoreline.\n\"The creature you call Monstro,\" Namor said. \"It was wounded by the careless maneuvering of a submarine, and thus driven to a frenzy by the pain.\"\n\"Yeah, no one likes a bad cut. Wait...\" she said. \"A submarine? How fast can those things go, anyway?\"\n\"The technological specifications of surface-dweller vessels matter little to me,\" Namor said. \"They will all soon be laid to waste. However, the fact that Monstro in its madness destroyed some settlements of Talocan did concern me. You have saved not just the lives of surface dwellers, but citizens of the deep, my people. So. For that you have our gratitude.\"\n\"Well, wow,\" Luna said. \"I don't know what to say.\"\n\"Perhaps you should say nothing. Not when more singing remains.\" Was that a little glint of good humor in Namor's eye? Or a subtle warning for Luna to stay in her lane? She wasn't sure until Namor spoke again. \"Let the humans here have one more night of revelry before the oceans rise.\"\n \"Since you're here... care to join me for an encore?\" Luna reached out her hand to Namor, hoping her music might help ease the tensions of two worlds clearly on the brink of war. \n\"The surface dwellers will get to see me perform soon enough,\" Namor said, each word soaked in disdain. \"And when that time comes, those who are wise will be cheering my name far louder than they cheer yours now.\" \n\"I find that hard to imagine,\" Luna said, glancing back towards her adoring public. \"You can't force people to love you, Namor. You have to earn it. And that's exactly what I try to do on this stage, every single night. The bond I have with my fans? That's something that no monster of the deep — not even you — can ever take away.\"\nLuna's icy gaze sent a chill down Namor's spine, but she quickly switched back to her usual positive persona the instant she turned to face the crowd. \"So, who's ready to get this show re-started?\"\nEven Monstro's roar couldn't have been heard over the pandemonium from the crowd. Music, Luna thought. It brings people together.\nBut as she watched a grim Namor silently disappear back into the ocean's depths, she wondered how much longer that would be the case...",

Though his wounds have healed, his upgraded armor now saves the lives of countless others when Tony dons it to become the world's greatest fighting machine—the invincible Iron Man!\nWhen the legions of the night descended upon New York City, Iron Man and his fellow Avengers turned their tower into a stronghold. From there, Tony leads the effort to unravel the mysteries of Chronovium and to reverse the Timestream Entanglement.",
    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10340000_HeroGalleryInfo_Story_#0_Content": "There are times, Tony Stark reflected, when a man just wants to be left alone to do his work. \nThe problem before him was tricky. Doctor Doom had unraveled the boundaries between different timestreams, causing them to overlap and tangle — and bring him directly into conflict with a second Doctor Doom from an alternate future. \nThis Timestream Entanglement had destabilized countless worlds and destroyed who knew how many dimensions that could not survive being overlaid onto another reality. \nTony had the glimmer of an idea of how to build a machine that would reintegrate the timelines and hopefully restore his own personal reality to the way it had been before. A future version of T'Challa and Shuri, along with the egghead Reed Richards himself were his main collaborators, though Peter Parker and some other locals gave some insight also. If they couldn't figure out how to get Trudy running, nobody could. \nThat machine has been a doozy. They were going to need massive amounts of this new element, Chronovium, to pull the construction off. The group had begun referring to it as the Timestream Reintegration Device, and because that was clumsy, they'd shortened it to TRD — which Tony affectionately referred to as Trudy. \nHe was in love with the idea of Trudy, but she was a fickle mistress, her solutions sometimes nearer and sometimes farther away as they learned more about the mechanisms of space-time and Chronovium.\nIt didn't help that Present Doom had locked down control of most satellite communications, and was constantly trying to sabotage their efforts in other ways. Or that Doom 2099 was also unleashing armies of Doombots. \nOr that New York, in the midst of its own time crisis, was under the thrall of Dracula and an army of vampires, which made a casual stroll from Avengers Tower to the Baxter Building a life-or-death risk. Or that the vampires were always on the lookout for ways to infiltrate Avengers Tower. \nCurrently, he was being interrupted by an alert from one of the lower elevator shafts in Avengers Tower, as a camera picked up what looked like a vampire. Contrary to popular folklore, they did show up on cameras. Maybe Dracula himself didn't, but his creations did. \n\"Friday,\" he said. \"Get me some better imaging.\"\n\"The creature isn't moving, boss,\" she answered. \"So there's no other angle.\"\nBelow the vampire, the elevator came up into view from a lower floor. Tony understood, just a moment too late. \nAs the elevator approached, the vampire leaped onto it and tore open the emergency exit. The elevator car passed out of camera view. \n\"Next camera!\" Tony snapped. He hated party crashers.\n\"On it, boss.\" Friday shifted the view. The car appeared, still going up. \n\"What floor is it headed for?\"\n\"Looks like this floor.\"\n\"That'll be a negative,\" Tony said. \"Stop it where it is.\"\nThe elevator chunked to a stop. \"It's between floors thirty-six and thirty-seven,\" Friday said. \nTony activated his armor. The nanotech-enabled suit built itself in seconds and came online before he could count to three. \"One more thing, Friday,\" he said. \"Who was on that elevator?\"\nShe named four techs from one of the labs studying superconducting materials on a lower floor.\nSo now he was possibly looking at five vampires, depending on how long it took to turn once the people in the elevator had been bitten. That seemed to vary quite a bit from person to person. \nEither way, no vampires were getting off that elevator. \nIron Man walked to the elevator door. \"Friday, open up.\"\nShe did, and Tony stepped into the shaft.\nHe dropped forty floors in free fall, then hit the brakes with his jet boots so he didn't snap the elevator's cable when he landed. The sound of his boots hitting the elevator car roof rang all the way back up the shaft, but it didn't drown out the screams from inside.\n \"Seeing five heat sources, boss,\" Friday said. \"One quite a bit cooler than the others.\" \nMaybe he was in luck, Tony thought. He dropped through the open hatch and took in the scene in a split second. The vampire stood casually in one corner of the car. The four techs cowered in the other corner. Tony, by sheer luck, had landed between them.\n\"Mister Stark!\" one of the techs cried out, in a sob of pure relief. \"You're here!\"\n\"Anybody bitten?\" he asked. \nNone of the techs said anything. The vampire smiled. \"All of them,\" it said slowly, drawing out the words. \nTony lit it up with repulsors, but it was quicker than he would have expected. It anticipated his aim, even in the closer quarters of the elevator car, and ducked away. \nThen it barreled through the victims, who screamed and fell over each other trying to escape the monster's clutches. Tony spun, repulsors hot, waiting for a shot that wouldn't take out one of the techs. Not all vampires turned their bite victims. He didn't know how it worked, but it was possible all of the techs would live if he could figure out how to get rid of the vampire.\nIt seized one of the techs and unhinged its mouth, poised to sink its fangs deep into the woman's neck flesh. She screamed and struggled, but it was much too strong for her. The vampire looked right at Tony, and in its eyes he saw that it planned to do as much damage as it could. It would drain his tech dry in front of him if he didn't do something about it. \nSo he took a chance. He waited until the vampire's focus wavered, just for the slightest moment, as it salivated for the tech's blood. That moment of wavering focus gave him the time he needed to snap up one gauntlet and blast the vampire off her neck with a repulsor.\n It hit the wall and the tech slumped to the floor. One of the other techs grabbed her and dragged her across the car as Tony stood over the stunned vampire and blasted it with both repulsors until he was sure he wouldn't have to do it again. \nThe techs' panicked breathing filled the elevator shaft, hearts pounding, counting their last moments as humans. \"Friday,\" Tony said without giving them a second look, \"start the elevator again. Floor sixty-seven.\"\nThe sixty-seventh floor of Stark Tower was a medical research lab. All four of the bitten techs were met by medical crews in full protective gear, and taken to separate isolation units. \nThe main bio researcher, Curt Connors, met Tony at the elevator. \"Doc,\" Tony said, \"time to try out the serum.\"\nConnors had a look on his face Tony knew all too well. \"Connors,\" Tony said. \"You look like you disagree with me, but don't want to tell me that because I'm your boss. Does that sound right?\"\n\"Yes,\" Connors said reluctantly. \"The serum isn't ready. It's not adequately tested.\"\n\"Those four people will probably die without it. I'd say they're willing test subjects.\"\nConnors was struggling, and Tony gave him credit for that. Ethically, it was a tricky proposal to give a poorly tested experimental formula to desperate people. \n\"Ask them yourself if they're okay with it first, if it'll make you feel better,\" Tony added. Guess the doctor had some previous anxieties over his own history with serums.\nThis appeared to mollify Doctor Connors somewhat. \"Okay. Okay, I will.\" \n\"And Doc?\" Tony called as Connors headed deeper into the lab.\n\"Yes, Mister Stark?\"\n\"Keep me updated on how they recover, will you?\"\nHe was alone in the elevator on his way back up to his lab, so everything was quiet until Friday broke the silence. \"Reed Richards called while you were...engaged in the elevator.\"\nDoom controlled satellite communications, but Tony and Reed had figured out a way to get very short calls through using old land lines and local area networks. They didn't use it often because they didn't want anyone to find out. Plus, it was a little embarrassing to be some of the smartest men on Planet Earth communicating via a glorified can and string. \n\"Oh, you should have put him through. I could have talked to him at the same time.\"\n\"Multi-tasking has always been your strong suit, sir.\"\n\"That's right!\" Tony snorted. \"Never forget when I fixed your bugs while buying out Hammer Industries. Call Reed back.\"\nReed Richards' face appeared on Tony's heads-up, reminding him that he was still in his armor. He made the armor disappear and Reed's face appeared as a thumbnail on the inside of Tony's glasses.\n \"Tony,\" Reed said. \"I thought you were sending the newest iteration of the Chronovium compounding formulas today.\"\n\"I did,\" Tony said. The elevator reached his floor and he got off.\n\"It never got here,\" Reed said. \n\"It's probably burying nuts somewhere, Reed,\" Tony said. \"It'll get there.\"\n\"We really can't afford to have our couriers detouring to bury nuts, Tony—\"\nReed said more but Tony didn't hear it because that was when the Doombots blew a bunch of holes in the wall and invaded his lab.\nTony came to expect carnage constantly nowadays. Energy blasts, explosions, the usual chaos. He was armored up and powered up before all of the Doombots had landed in the lab. There were eight of them. Seven stood near the shattered windows, their cloaks waving in the wind. \nThe eighth held up a cage containing a squirrel. \n\"Stand down, everyone! Stand down!\" Tony held up his hands and dematerialized his suit's helmet. He had to know whether the Chronovium formulas were still in the little chip that squirrel carried around its neck. With the garlic. \nIf Doom had those formulas, he would know more about how Tony and Reed were trying to build Trudy. Which would make it easier for Doom to sabotage Trudy, and force Tony and Reed to change some of their plans.\n\"Oh, you found our lost squirrel,\" he said. \"Appreciate you bringing it, I mean, him back. But just so we're clear, I'm still going to oppose you taking over the world.\"\n\"Squirrels,\" the Doombot said, in Doom's unmistakable tone of scorn. \"Your methods remain as absurd and moronic as ever, Stark. I am returning this animal to you because to harm it would be beneath me.\"\nAnother voice rang out in the lab. Tony looked. Uh oh, he thought. \n\"You,\" Squirrel Girl said as she walked in to the lab, tail stiff and face grim. \"You kidnapped Cyril!\"\nTony had to cool the situation out until he knew whether Doom had taken the information the squirrel carried. \"Hey, Doreen, everything's fine, the Doombot brought Cyril back. No need to —\"\n\"Tony, you know I really admire the heck out of you, but this is not the time to be talking down to me,\" Squirrel Girl said. She advanced across the lab and snatched the cage from the Doombot's hand. \"Doom, I know you're in there,\" she said, standing close to the Doombot's face. \"If you did anything to Cyril, he'll tell me about it, and then I'm going to come after you and you'll wish you'd never been born!\"\n\"Doreen,\" Tony said. \"Why don't you just take the squirrel — \"\n\"His name is Cyril!\"\n\"Why don't you just take Cyril and make sure he's okay?\" Tony caught Doreen's eye and saw that she understood what he meant. Cyril would tell her if Doctor Doom or any of the Doombots had examined his information payload. \nShe backed away, glaring at the Doombot and then cocking her head to one side, presumably because Cyril was telling her something interesting.\n\"What's he saying?\" Tony asked. \n\"He says the Doombots fed him and he wants to go finish his mission now.\" Doreen's eyes shone with pride. \"Isn't he just a little trooper?\"\n\"He sure is,\" Tony said. Would Doreen have told him in front of the Doombots if Doom had messed around with Cyril's payload? He thought so. But it was hard to be sure, and there was so much at stake...\n\"I know what you are doing, Stark,\" the Doombot said, its tone now mocking. \"You and Reed, and your Wakandan partners. You will be fine challengers, but in the end you and your machine will not be able to stop me. Victor von Doom will control space-time, for all pasts and all futures! You dabble in the mysteries of Chronovium, but I created it! And I will master it, and I will bring time itself to heel. You have been warned.\"\nThe Doombots backed toward the shattered windows and rocketed away into the night. \n\"Reed, did you get all that?\" Tony asked. The call had been open the whole time.\n\"I did,\" Reed's voice remained unwavering.\n\"Think it's time we reconsidered some of our research pathways, if Doom knows about the compounding formulas.\"\n\"Sounds like it,\" Reed says. \"But didn't the squirrel say nothing happened?\"\nTony sighed at the fact of living in a world where that sentence made sense. \"Yeah,\" he breathed. \"It did. But I'm not totally inclined to let our entire project depend on acorn eaters, you know? No offense, kid. There were any number of ways Doom might have accessed the data without the squirrel ever knowing.\"\n\"I concur,\" Reed said. \"I'll start retooling things over here.\"\n\"Okay, I'm gonna do a little math and get back to you in the morning. Ha ha, there's no morning here, but I'll get back to you after I get some sleep.\"\n\"Try not to lose any more squirrels.\" And with that, Reed broke the connection.\n\"Nobody lost a squirrel,\" Doreen retorted. Her tone was pretty heated. She'd been ready for a fight, and now she hadn't had one, so all that aggression had nowhere to go.\n\"Nope. We didn't. Cyril's all good?\" She nodded. \"Then how about you let him go back to the park, and we'll think about how we communicate with Reed going forward.\" \n\"I'll do anything to help, Tony,\" Doreen leapt up. She had that starry-eyed look she sometimes got around him. It drove Tony a little crazy, but he also found it charming, and it also made him feel good, because if he had the admiration of someone as good and pure as Doreen Green, he couldn't be such a bad person after all. \n\"Well, Doreen, we have two Victor von Dooms, with two competing visions of how to tyrannize the future we all have to live in, and while we try to stop one or both of them, we also have to fight a vampire army.\" Tony walked her to the elevators. \"So, there's plenty for everyone to do. And this sounds really weird in my head even before I say it...but we might not be able to do it without you and your squirrels.\"\n\"I know,\" she said. \"And when you get your machine built, you better remember that.\" \nWith a flick of her bushy tail, she was gone into the elevator. Tony had a grin on his face as he surveyed the damage to his lab. Nothing that couldn't be repaired. And if Squirrel Girl was going to make good on her threat to make Victor von Doom wish he'd never been born...well, that was a future worth fighting for all by itself.",

But what this child didn't seem to realize was that Venom was more than just a rippling mass of xenomorphic protoplasm — a fearsome sight with claws and tongue and teeth, all ready to deal deadly damage to any who dared oppose him. Underneath his alien exterior was a regular human named Eddie Brock.\nThe symbiotic bond shared by the pair had granted Eddie extraordinary abilities and had given the alien a purpose. Together, as Venom, they had become a lethal protector, stalking the streets to bring their own brand of justice to those who harmed the innocent. \nOr at least, so they thought. To be honest, the details of Venom's past felt a little hazy. When his own reality collapsed around him, the Klyntar hivemind that connected Venom to his fellow symbiotes overloaded Eddie's brain and left him and his alien counterpart completely disoriented. They weren't quite sure where they had come from, and they certainly weren't sure where — or when — they were now. \n\"We're free now,\" Venom said, assessing his former captor. \"And you look far less dangerous than they do.\"\n\"You'd be surprised...\" Magik retorted. \n\"We'll take our chances, little one,\" Venom continued, stepping forward to join his beautiful-but-deadly new companion in the fray. \"So... who are we fighting?\"\n\"The Gods,\" Magik replied casually. \"Well, the ones that are left.\"\nAs Venom surveyed the endless battlefield, he realized that the young Mutant was not exaggerating. Somehow he had ended up in a nether realm where occult forces were locked in an eternal war. This was far beyond the types of battles he had previously been accustomed to. Fighting criminals and Spider-Men on the streets of New York was easy compared to facing off against demons and demigods in a cross-dimensional hellscape. \nIn a place like this, there was no right and wrong. No innocent and guilty. These were divine forces at war. And both halves of Venom were beginning to realize just how mortal they were. \n\"How can we possibly slay gods, little one?\" Venom asked, genuinely curious.\n\"A big sword always works for me,\" Magik replied with a smile, giving her own weapon another skillful thrust into the oncoming hordes. \nVenom almost let out a chuckle, glad to finally find a taste of humor amidst the horrors of this strange war. But instead, he fell to his knees and let out a primal scream as daggers of pain suddenly pierced through every fiber of his being. It was as if an alarm had sounded inside his head, sending his symbiote side into a frenzy. \nIn his mind, he saw images of a distant planet shrouded in darkness, accompanied by the anguished cries of a million living creatures. But there was something more. Something was alive deep inside the world itself — someone whose presence felt as cold as the void of space. And they were desperate to find a way out. \n\"What just happened?\" Magik asked, offering a hand to help Venom to his feet. \n\"The hivemind...\" Venom said, slowly recovering his senses. \"It's a group consciousness... a kind of network that allows symbiotes to communicate. And they just sent us one hell of a message.\" \n\"What did it say?\" Magik asked, hiding her fear of what the answer might be.\n\"They want us to come home to their planet,\" Venom responded. \"They want us to slay Knull before he can slay us all.\" \n\"Knull? Who's that?\" Magik inquired. \n\"Our--their god,\" Venom said.\n\"Then you'd better get yourself a sword,\" Magik replied dryly before returning her attention to the battle at hand. \"The bigger the better.\"\n\"Yes...\" Venom mused. \"And we think we know where to find one...\" \nVenom had heard the legends from his symbiote kin. Long ago, Knull wielded a mighty blade known as All-Black, the Necrosword. It was said that he had once used the weapon to strike down a Celestial — one of the oldest and most powerful cosmic entities in the known universe. Stories claim that Knull triumphed, but that the Necrosword was lost in the fray. Lost... but perhaps not gone forever... \nIf the sword was still out there somewhere, Venom knew he had to find it. But he was more skilled at swinging through dark alleys than surfing the space ways. \n\"So... how do we get to the other side of the galaxy before all of reality is consumed by darkness?\" Venom asked, not expecting Magik to have an answer. \n\"Easy,\" she responded, her eyes beginning to sparkle with energy. \"Just show me where you want to go.\"\nVenom reached out to the young girl, allowing a small portion of his symbiote half to slither on to her bare skin. As the alien entity formed a new bond with Magik, it instinctively tapped into her Mutant ability to open interdimensional portals. In the blink of an eye, a doorway across the cosmos had opened in front of them. \nAs Venom stepped through the portal and into the unknown, he turned and waved to Magik. \n\"Thank you, madam.\" He uttered. She nodded back knowingly before returning her attention to her arcane enemies. Both warriors had impossible battles ahead, yet they were well aware that they had no choice but to keep fighting for as long as it took to claim victory. \nAs relieved as he was to leave the war-torn nether world behind, Venom had no time to celebrate his escape. Everything was being drowned out by the collective fear coursing through the symbiote hivemind. If Knull were to return, he would not rest until all that was left was endless oblivion. The King in Black was determined to rule once more, and his first act would be to erase all life in the universe. Venom could not let that happen. \nWhen Venom emerged from Magik's gateway, he found himself standing upon the towering remains of a slaughtered Celestial, adrift in the void. He could sense a darkness on its colossal corpse, similar to the sensation he felt when the hivemind revealed Knull's presence on their homeworld. \nHe soon saw the hilt of a sword jutting from the Celestial's side. Around the wound the buried blade had inflicted, an ebony energy bubbled and churned like a cosmic infection that had been left untreated for eons. Venom reached for the handle of the Necrosword. He began to pull... but the blade would not budge. Its darkness had spread across the Celestial's armored surface, cementing it in place. But Venom was never one to give up easily. So he pulled again. And again. And again. But to no avail. \nWith his full focus on the task at hand, Venom failed to notice that he was no longer alone. Some sort of cosmic cocoon — a mysterious vessel with an even more mysterious passenger — had drifted close to the Celestial Remains. And little did Venom realize that the man slumbering inside this protective shell had just awoken what was left of the fallen Celestial's consciousness...\nAs Venom gave the hilt of All-Black one last mighty pull, the Celestial let out a psionic scream — not from the physical pain of the blade impaled in its side, but rather from the mental anguish it was experiencing as it communed with its other cosmic companion. But the reason behind the Celestial's screech did not matter to Venom. All that he cared about were the end results. \nKnocked back by the Celestial's violent outburst of posthumous pain, Venom was sent tumbling aimlessly through space. As he plummeted through the void, he watched as All-Black, now awoken from its slumber, buried itself deeper into the Celestial until it disappeared from view. He would have to find his way back to it with aid, perhaps from his new mystic ally. If he could survive crashlanding into the planet that he was swiftly approaching, that is.\nBracing himself, Venom feared he was about to leave behind nothing more than an impact crater as his legacy. But his arrival on the planet's surface was unexpectedly soft, as if he had been caught and cradled by a million loving hands. As he rose, he realized that there was good reason for his surprisingly safe landing. \nHe was home. This was Klyntar, planet of the symbiotes. And they had unexpected company. \nNearby, Venom saw an unusual object — the very same cosmic cocoon that he had failed to notice during his time at the Celestial Remains. It too had been hurled through the void and onto Klyntar's surface, delivered as if by fate itself. But while Venom was welcomed home by his brethren as a champion, the cocoon was seemingly about to be swallowed by a sea of hungry symbiotes. \nVenom could not allow that. Not without knowing what — or who — was inside. With fang and claw, he tore through the cocoon's protective outer shell. Within moments, a figure emerged from inside — clearly more golden god than mortal man. \nVenom watched and waited as the new arrival gained his bearings, not sure if he was friend or foe. His question was swiftly answered as the luminous warrior turned and attacked him. \n\"Don't know who you are, goldie...\" Venom said, watching the planet undulate around him, \"...but I've got work to do. And I won't let you stand in my way.\" \n\"I am Adam Warlock,\" the man said, \"and I will not let you corrupt this universe with your darkness, living shadow!\" \nVenom instantly lowered his shoulders and laughed. \n\"You think I'm Knull?\" he said. \"You've got it all wrong, sir. I am no King in Black. I'm the one who came here to end his reign. Permanently.\" \nAdam Warlock paused and looked at Venom. He had not expected to find himself fighting alongside a creature of such darkness. But he would gladly accept any ally willing to join him in his crusade. \nThe battle for the fate of the universe was about to begin, and for the first time in ages, Venom felt as if he knew exactly who he was and where he belonged. \nHe would stand on the side of the light... as long as the faintest glimmer still remained...",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10360000_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "Every week or so, Peter Parker swung uptown from his usual haunts to the Manhattan side of the Queensboro Bridge, looking across toward home. And every week, there was no way to get there. Too many vampires patrolling the bridge, and other horrific flying monsters over it. Dracula had Manhattan all to himself, and he wasn't letting any of his human \"playthings\" escape.\nStill Peter came by to look, wishing he could talk to Aunt May. Every Wednesday. That's when he missed Aunt May the most, because ever since he'd moved out of her house, he'd always tried to get back to see her for lunch on Wednesdays.\nToday, he was staying a little farther away from the bridge, watching it from the Midtown Tunnel's ventilation tower, a mile downstream past the UN headquarters. It was a quiet place for contemplation, since the huge fans were no longer running. He had cased the area for vampires before letting himself have his weekly moment of regret and longing, for a world before the Timestream Entanglement, before the vampires had taken over New York, before he had lost track of the days since he'd seen the sun. Gazing at the bridge under the dead eye of Dracula's moon, lost in thought, Peter was thinking about two things at once. One, he was frustrated about not being able to help out with the construction of the Timestream Reintegration Device, which everyone was calling the TRD except Tony Stark, who of course had built an AI interface for it called Trudy. \nTwo, he was remembering when he had been here the week before, about the same time — although it was hard to know what time it was when the sun never came up and the moon always hung full over the river. He'd been wishing he could see Aunt May, just like tonight, when he noticed a twinkling in the air, just in front of him. It got a little brighter, and a folded piece of paper appeared out of nowhere, pinched between two fingers. The hand disappeared and the piece of paper drifted down to rest on Peter's right knee.\nHuh, he thought. That didn't happen every day.\nHe unfolded the paper and read.\n \n\tPeter,\n\tThe Master Weaver told me to find you and tell you that the Web of Life and Destiny needs you. I will reach out again when it is time for you to come here. That time will be soon.\n\tSpider-Zero\n\t \nSpider-Zero? Master Weaver? Peter had never heard of either, nor did he have any idea what the Web of Life and Destiny might be. But he found out the next day — well, the next night, when a portal popped open next to him while he was patrolling the East Village. A young woman was on the other side. She said his name.\n\"That would make you Spider-Zero, I guess?\" Peter said. \"Do you have an actual person name?\"\nShe ignored his question. \"We need you, Peter. The Web of Life and Destiny needs you.\"\n\"I don't — I belong here.\"\n\"Let me show you.\"\nHe hadn't wanted to go through the portal. Something told him it would be hard to get back, for any number of possible reasons, and he couldn't take the chance. So Spider-Zero showed him the Web of Life and Destiny through the portal. The night sky beyond it blazed with portals and stars. The city below it — so, so far below it — was a dark splendor of neon-lit towers and shadow, extending to the horizon in every direction.\n\"See, Peter? This is your destiny. If the Web fails, all Spider-People will disappear. Including you. And not too long after that, reality comes apart. The Web is what holds it all together.\"\nHe'd had to say no. \"If you ever need me, you know where to find me,\" he said. \"I'll come and help, but New York is my home. I belong here.\"\nShe hadn't pressed him, but she did say she would be coming back. And Peter hadn't been able to get the vision of the Web out of his head since then.\nNow, sitting and watching the bridge, Peter was thinking that the Web was like the model of the universe Tony talked about, with dimensions wrapped up in tight strings that vibrated through space-time and intersected...well, like a web. Peter knew a little about string theory, but the way Tony talked about space-time when he and Reed were working out the math for the TRD? That was just a bit beyond Peter's reach. He could see what it was the way you could see what Arthur Douglas was doing on the saxophone. Doing it yourself was another level. Peter was a bit crestfallen at having to admit this to himself, but hey, at least he still had streets to patrol and citizens to save from vampires and other creatures of the night.\nCould be worse.\nOn the other hand, if he'd gone to that futuristic Tokyo, maybe touching the Web would have somehow put him in touch with the true nature of the universe, helped him find some insight into the model Tony was trying to construct...\nNo. He was right where he belonged. Or, he amended as he looked at the bridge, at least he was close to where he belonged. \nAs he had that thought, Peter felt his ears pop. He looked to his left and there were Cloak and Dagger.\n\"Hi guys,\" Peter said.\n\"Thought we might find you here,\" Dagger said. \n\"Well, it is Wednesday,\" Peter said. \nCloak watched the area for any vampires. \"Glad you didn't go to Tokyo.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Dagger agreed. \"We need you here. The resistance against Dracula can't spare anyone.\" Spider-Man knew it. There weren't many of them in the underground that fought back against vampires. The three of them, Squirrel Girl of course...that was the core group. The Winter Soldier used to help out, but most of the Avengers were holed up in Tony's tower fighting off Doombots and trying to undo whatever Doctor Doom had done. Same with the Fantastic Four. So, the day-to-day battle in the streets to save ordinary citizens and try to break the vampire stranglehold on the city was left to the five of them, and the citizens themselves. Well, he should say night-to-night, because the sun hadn't shone on Manhattan in weeks. \n\"Speaking of finding you,\" Dagger went on, \"we're getting a little worried.\" \nCloak picked up where she left off. \"Don't want to be a downer, but you're here most Wednesdays. If you get predictable, Dracula's gonna figure it out. He'll be watching for you.\"\nOne of the vampires always patrolling the UN headquarters looked up and saw them. Peter pointed it out. \"You mean they already know, right?\"\n\"I was kinda trying to ease you into it,\" Cloak said. \nThe lead vampire gave a hoarse cry as the horde appeared. Leaping ten yards at a time, they reached the basketball courts at the base of the tower and began to climb.\n\"We can handle this,\" Dagger said. Daggers of light appeared in both of her hands, and Cloak spread his cloak wide. From experience, they'd learned that vampires did not do well in the Darkforce dimension. Peter looked around automatically, noting anchor points for web. Sometimes in situations like this, he wished he had a weapon, but that wasn't his style. \nMore vampires appeared along the rooflines of nearby buildings. All of them were the lower, semi-sentient type, the quick creations of Dracula and other vampires. Good for instilling fear among regular people, but they'd taken down a few Super Heroes too. There were at least six of them climbing up the tower. \"Peter,\" Dagger said quietly. He saw her glance up toward the roofs. \"There are too many. This was a setup.\"\nIt sure felt that way. But who had set them up? \nRight now, with a half-dozen vampires almost close enough to touch and a ton of others ready to drop on them from the rooftops, it didn't matter. What mattered was staying alive. \nPerfectly synchronized, the vampires swung up onto the top of the ventilation tower. But Spider-Man, Cloak, and Dagger had gotten pretty well synchronized too, tag-teaming in and out as they swung into action. Dagger's twin blades of light streaked out, and two vampires toppled screeching back off the tower. Cloak popped out, sweeping the fabric of his cloak out to swallow two others. Spider-Man swept the legs out from under the fifth and popped up to punch the sixth off the edge of the roof. When he turned back to the fifth, it had already been swallowed and teleported who knows where.\nNow, vampires were leaping and crawling down from the surrounding rooftops. Too many to fight. They were all going to be trapped if they didn't get out of there. Cloak held his cloak open for Dagger. She glanced back at Peter. \"Want a ride?\"\n\"No thanks,\" Peter said. He'd been through the Darkforce dimension a couple of times and he would rather try to outrun the vampires. \"I got this.\"\nShe waved and disappeared inside Cloak. \"Be safe,\" Cloak said, and then he too was gone. The wash of Darkforce energy gave Peter a momentary feeling like he was in a falling elevator.\nWhen it passed, the dog park at the base of the tower was swarming with vampires. More spilled out of the First Avenue tunnel, or out of the Tudor City apartment building across the avenue. Spider-Man was pretty good in a fight, but he didn't like his chances against two dozen vampires. It was time to swing out of there, live to fight another day. \nThwip! He shot a line of webbing across 42nd Street, exactly where he'd wanted it — within six feet of the roofline. Everything was going to work out.\nThen, as he tensed for the jump, a vampire tore out the screen on top of the ventilation shaft and seized both of Peter's ankles. It pulled backwards, letting itself fall into the shaft, and Peter fell with it. \nHe held onto his webbing with one hand and aimed the other downward as the vampire bared its fangs to bite into his leg. He cocooned its head in webbing, but he was swinging back and forth so violently that he also managed to stick its hands to his ankles. Below them were the fans.\nThe line of webbing from the top of the building, which had been sawing against the sharp metal edge of the ventilation shaft screen, snapped. Spider-Man and the vampire fell, crashing down onto one of the fan blades. It snapped and they fell deeper, into a narrower part of the shaft, where they splashed into deep, cold water in nearly perfect darkness. Peter clung to the wall. He could feel the vampire thrashing under the water. They didn't breathe, so he didn't think it would drown. He did know that the water would dissolve his webbing faster than the air, so he pulled it up, and with the last of his webbing stuck it to the wall just above the waterline. Its eyes glowed red in the darkness, visible even through the webbing wrapping its face. The noises coming from inside the webbing were something out of a nightmare. \nThe whole situation was something out of a nightmare. Trapped in a flooded ventilation shaft, literally attached to a vampire that would bite him the minute his webbing dissolved from its face. He could see its jaws working, trying to chew through. Dracula's lower-level minions were not your sophisticated Bela Lugosi-style vampires. They were all appetite and hate. Spider-Man really didn't want to be in the same room with it when it got loose, but he didn't have any way to fight it. Already the light coming from its eyes seemed brighter. Pretty soon it would rip its way out of the webbing, and then it would rip its way into Peter. \nMind racing, Peter tried to figure a way out. He came up empty. He was just settling on a plan to climb back up the shaft, dragging the vampire with him, and hope the bonds around his ankles came loose before the vampire could get its mouth open — desperate, maybe, but not impossible — when he heard sounds from the top of the ventilation shaft.\nThere were more vampires on the roof.\nThere were other times in his life when Peter thought he might be about to die. It was part of the life of a Super Hero. But right now, it seemed pretty certain, and the pit of his stomach was colder than the water below his feet.\nThe vampire started to thrash its head around. The webbing on its face was beginning to fray. Its eyes were clear, staring through holes in the webbing. He could feel its hands flexing around his ankles. Above, Peter could hear the snarls of other vampires trying to descend the shaft.\nA series of heavy bangs echoed down the shaft, and a vampire plunged into the water head-first. Peter froze, trying to gauge where it would come up...but it didn't come up. Where there had been snarling and chaos up at the top of the shaft, now there was silence. \nThen the slow, laborious sound of feet scraping down the inside of the shaft. Bats began fluttering down the shaft, their wings occasionally brushing Peter's face. \nThis is it, Peter thought. The vampire stuck to his ankles was nearly free. He could feel it flexing its wrists, and he could see parts of its fangs through the thinning webbing that still covered the lower part of its face. Luckily it still couldn't open its mouth, but it wouldn't be long. \nPeter watched as a figure in a long black coat hung from the underside of the fan. He couldn't quite see its face. Then it spoke. \"Huh. Wouldn't have figured on finding you down here, Spider-Man.\"\nPeter knew that voice, but he couldn't quite believe he was hearing it. \"Morbius?\"\n\"In the living vampire flesh.\" Morbius surveyed Peter's predicament. \"You're in a tight spot. Good thing I came along.\"\n\"Why, you want to finish me off yourself? Bring me as a trophy to Dracula?\"\n\"Are you kidding? Vampires scorn and despise regular people like you, but they hate me. Like, really hate me.\" Morbius did something Peter couldn't see, and the vampire attached to Peter's ankles went limp. \"How long until the webbing dissolves?\"\n\"In cold water? Not very much longer. But if you have a jackknife, we could move things along.\"\nMorbius extended a claw from his hand, swiping away at the web, cutting Peter free. They climbed back out of the shaft and on the rooftop where lay seven vampires strewn in different violent poses. \"How did you do that?\" Peter asked. \nMorbius grinned without humor. \"To the lesser creations, I just look like another bat. Wouldn't fool Dracula, but these things?\" He nudged one of them with his foot. \"They're not the smartest tools in the shed.\"\nPeter started to put two and two together, and he was reaching a conclusion he couldn't quite believe. But he had to ask. \"Did you...did you know I was going to be here?\"\n\"I've been watching you. And I've been watching some of the vampires watching you. You ought to be more careful on Wednesdays.\" Morbius looked around the area. \"In fact, we probably shouldn't stay here.\"\n\"We?\"\n\"Spider-Man, I came looking for you because we need to work together,\" Morbius said. \"I've been skulking around Manhattan by myself, but sooner or later Dracula's going to get me. Same with you, only I know you've got some friends. I could use some friends, and our chance of surviving is better if we band together.\"\nPeter considered this. Morbius was probably right, but it felt a little weird to be relying on a vampire — even a scientifically created one — in a battle against Dracula.\n\"Also, I think I know a way to get into Dracula's castle,\" Morbius added.\n\"You do?\" Peter thought harder. He made a decision. Let Tony handle the TRD. He would stick to the moonlit streets and take the fight straight to Dracula. Morbius would be a definite asset on that front. On the other hand...\n\"This is going to be a tricky conversation with you know who,\" he said. \nMorbius laughed. Peter couldn't help smiling too.",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10370010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "As he gazed off into the distance towards the line where the ocean met the sky, Magneto's cape fluttered gently in the calm breeze that was drifting across the coast of the sentient island nation of Krakoa. His was a life far longer than most people ever had the chance to live, and this was one of the few moments of true peace that he could recall. But he knew from experience it would not last for long. It never did. \n\"Something on your mind, old man?\" a familiar voice asked from above, breaking the silence. As Magneto glanced up, there, hovering on the wind like a majestic goddess, was Ororo Munroe — the Mutant weather manipulator known as Storm. \n\"Funny, isn't it,\" mused Magneto, \"that we fought all those years for a better future for Mutantkind… and now we have finally found it, further in the future than any of us ever imagined.\"\nNot so long ago, the sovereign nation of Krakoa had been swept up in a chronal storm — a time-twisting anomaly that would have ripped the island to bits if not for Ororo's deft manipulation of its tumultuous currents. Instead of becoming lost in the timestream forever, Krakoa arrived safely on the other side of the tempest in the year 2099. The future that Mutantkind had always dreamed of was finally theirs to claim. And Magneto was never one to let such an auspicious opportunity pass him by. \n\"It matters not what century we are in,\" Storm said. \"What matters is that our people have a home here on Krakoa, thanks to you, Erik…\" \nMagneto cringed as his old friend called him by his human name. True, he had gone by many of them over the decades — Max Eisenhardt, Erik Lehnsherr, Magnus — but they were monikers he had merely tolerated in order to better fit into a world where Homo Sapiens still believed themselves in control. Here, in this new era, he could choose a name that spoke to who he truly was. Magneto — the Mutant Master of Magnetism. \n\"I may be leading the cause to find our fellow Mutants and bring them to this safe harbor, my dear,\" said Magneto, \"but the success of this crusade cannot be attributed to one Mutant alone.\" \n\"You're damn right it can't, bub,\" a grizzled voice snarled from the edge of the jungle that bordered Krakoa's shore. \nMagneto and Storm both turned to see a familiar figure walking out of a newly-blossomed Krakoan gate. The short, hairy figure looked as though he had just been to hell and back. And knowing Wolverine, that could very literally be the case. Alongside Wolverine stood a young Mutant, just old enough for her powers to begin manifesting.\n\"Found the kid who got sucked through that dimensional rift,\" Wolverine continued. \"She's lucky I went in there after her. Limbo is no place for a new Mutant.\"\n\"I couldn't disagree more,\" another voice said, this one with a hint of a Russian accent. \"This New Mutant has managed just fine there.\" \n\"Illyana? Can it truly be?!\" Storm rushed over to the young woman who had just stepped through the gateway, instantly wrapping her in an embrace. For years, Illyana Rasputin, the Mutant teleporter known as Magik, had been like a daughter to Storm. Before she was claimed by the darkness of Limbo… Before… \n\"Nice to see you too, Windrider,\" said Magik with an uncomfortable smirk. \"It's been… longer than I care to remember…\" \nMagneto stepped towards the new arrival, not embracing her, but examining her closely instead. There was something strange about her. It was clear that she had walked a far different path than the Illyana Rasputin of his world. This child had been hardened by the horrors of war, something to which Magneto himself could closely relate. \n\"You are not the child we once knew,\" Magneto said. \"But you are welcome here on Krakoa. All Mutants are, regardless from where or when they hail.\" \n\"How about people who grew up thinking they were Mutants, only to have their entire world turned upside down when they learned the truth years later…?\"\nMagneto audibly gasped as the question was asked by another woman who had just arrived through the Krakoan gateway. His gaze instantly shifted over to her as she walked forward. Her every step stirred ripples across his memory, for he had been there when she had taken her very first ones so many years ago.\n\"Wanda…\" \n\"Hello, father,\" the Scarlet Witch said as she approached Magneto with a calm confidence that few had ever shown in his presence. She reached up and began to slowly remove Magneto's helmet, an action that would almost certainly be met with instant retaliation should anyone else attempt it. But Magneto stood as silent as solid steel, simply basking in the magic of his long lost daughter's company. His stoic expression softened as Wanda leaned in and gave him a gentle kiss on the cheek. \n\"How… How can you be here?\" Magneto managed to say. He could bend Adamantium into any shape with his Mutant power, but these simple words were somehow nearly impossible to form. \n\"It took a bit of work,\" Wanda mused. \"I'm not technically a Mutant like you, after all, which means Krakoa wouldn't normally let me through its gates. But a touch of chaos magic did the trick.\" \n\"What I meant to say is…\" \n\"Oh…\" Wanda's playful tone vanished faster than a stage magician's pet rabbit. \"Your Wanda… She's gone, isn't she? I'm sorry… This must be difficult…\" \n\"Quite the opposite,\" Magneto said, regaining his composure. \"To see your face again, to hear your voice, to know that — somewhere in this vast Multiverse a version of you has thrived — is perhaps the least difficult thing I could ever conceive. It is all that any father ever wants.\"  \n\"I wouldn't say I've been thriving, exactly,\" Wanda admitted. \"I've been holding my own universe together by its threads for far too long. I truly believed that I was its only hope to survive.\"\n\"Like father, like daughter,\" chuckled Wolverine. \n\"But I've started to see the bigger picture,\" Wanda continued. \"We're all fighting our own wars. The only chance we have of winning them and keeping all of our universes intact is if we start fighting together.\" \n\"Speakin' of fightin', I'm late for a date with Natasha,\" Wolverine said. \"We've got ourselves a tin-plated dictator that needs overthrowin'.\"\nMagneto almost chastised Wolverine for entrenching himself in the petty squabbles between the humans of this era, but he paused for a moment and considered his daughter's words. Perhaps she was right. Perhaps his own war to preserve Mutantkind was just one battle of many, all of them equally important.\n\"Since Krakoa arrived in this future, my allegiance has been to Mutantkind alone,\" said Magneto. \"I felt it best to isolate our people in order to protect them. But your words inspire me, my dear. It is clear that no Mutant is an island.\" \n\"Except Krakoa, da?\" Magik chimed in playfully. \n\"In order to commit to such an alliance, however, it must be a mutually beneficial one,\" Magneto continued. \"There are still Mutants out there, lost across space and time, who require our assistance in order to lead them home.\" \n\"That sounds like the perfect task for a Sorceress Supreme,\" Wanda said. \"But I'll require your help. As fond as I am of your classic look, I think we're in need of use a helmet that's a bit more functional.\"\n\"Of course,\" Magneto said, raising his hand into the air. Within moments, tiny scraps of metal buried beneath the sand of Krakoa's beaches converged and reshaped themselves into a complex yet familiar device once worn by Charles Xavier himself — Cerebro. \n\"If I recall, old school Cerebro was capable of tracking down Mutants anywhere in the world,\" said Wanda. \"But a few arcane enhancements should expand the helmet's search area to include adjacent dimensions as well. Like you said, all Mutants are welcome here, regardless from where or when they hail.\"\n\"Well?\" said Magik, her eyes burning with anticipation. \"Try it on already, old man!\" \nThe moment Magneto put on the helmet, he saw flashes of powerful Mutants scattered across the Multiverse. A telepathic ninja trapped in a strange world of unholy amusements. A king of the seas preparing to strike at the unsuspecting surface world. A powerful cosmic presence determined to burn the darkness out of the night sky. And thousands more, each yearning to defy fate and to find their place in an ever-shifting cavalcade of timelines and realities. \n\"There is much work to be done,\" Magneto said. \"Far more than I expected. When do we begin?\" \n\"No time better than the present…\" said Magik. \"Or the future, I guess. Wherever we are.\" \n\"You have given Mutants a gift this day, Wanda,\" Magneto said proudly. \"Your efforts will not be forgotten.\"\n\"I'm going to hold you to that,\" Wanda replied. \"And when the time comes, the army that you're about to gather may very well be the one that tips the balance in our favor.\"\n\"Then let this be a call to all Mutants across time and space,\" Magneto continued. \"The gates of Krakoa are open to them. In the words of a dear old friend…\" \n\"…to me, my X-Men.\"",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10380010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "Wanda Maximoff meditated, her body hovering a foot off the ground and her body wreathed in chaos energy. She was surrounded by a low wall, beyond which the cliffs and ridges of Wundagore Mountain sloped away into the clouds below. \nShe did this every day, opening her mind to the vast magical undercurrents of her broken world. Sensing where arcane power was building, where different forms of magic clashed and threatened wider conflicts. Reality was fragile, filled with gods and monsters that would willingly destroy it to increase their own power.\nWanda.\nShe twitched, the sound of her name pricking at the bubble of meditation. Wanda had spent years honing her ability to detect the smallest fluctuations in the field of magical power woven into the fabric of reality. This was part of her task as Sorceress Supreme of a reality that constantly tried to tear itself apart. Whenever magical adepts were active, she needed to know. Not to mention, it had been quite some time since someone used her name.\nWanda.\nThe words were laced with a shadowy tinge vaguely familiar to her, but from beyond her realm. That put her on the defensive. Only dangerous magic could traverse the spaces between universes. She was the Sorceress Supreme of this universe and she had tasted dark magic many a time before. Her unique mastery of chaos had transformed her into a primal force of order. When the immense tides of temporal power threatened to tear this universe apart, it was Wanda who felt the surge and turned it aside. Tamed it, held it in check. \nUntil it surged again.\nAnd it always did, because this universe was an entangled battleground, and she the only one who could hold its fibers together.\nSince the cataclysmic disruption of space-time itself, Wanda had spent more and more time locked in an arcane clash few people in her reality could even detect. The collapse of different histories had brought mighty enemies together and unleashed vast forces. Wanda knew she was, in the end, her reality's last line of defense, the only magical force capable of keeping the conflicting timestreams from ripping her world apart. If magical power were to surge unchecked, her reality would be annihilated. \nWanda.\nThe voice seemed familiar. Perhaps someone she had known, an echo of a soul long departed…\nWanda. It's Stephen. Stephen Strange.\n\"Stephen Strange?\" \nThe sound of her voice carried in the thin mountain air, challenging the wind beyond her Sanctum. \nNot the Stephen Strange you know. \n\"No, the Strange I knew is dead.\" He had been a great sorcerer, but he had fallen in the final battle of the first Demon War, when Hell itself spilled over into what was once Las Vegas. Wanda remembered that day with great sadness. She had led a mighty band of arcane adepts to victory, but their losses had been great.\nThe voice — she had sensed its nature and now knew it to be an astral projection — sighed. Yeah, I've heard that a lot recently.\n\"What do you mean?\"\nI've tried to reach out to the Sorcerers Supreme of many different realities, Wanda. In most of those realities, I'm dead. In a few of them, other versions of me didn't believe who I was. You're the first person who has carried the conversation this far, and that's good, because my world is in mortal danger and I need to be able to help it.\n\"The Stephen Strange I knew could astrally project and return like he was flipping a coin,\" Wanda said.\nUsually I can too, but something about the Timestream Entanglement trapped me in…an entangled astral plane is the best way I can describe it. There are too many other versions of me. I can't figure out which one of them is the correct one to return to.\nAh. Now she understood. \"And you think I can?\"\nI'm sure you can. Your chaos powers ought to be perfectly tuned to sort through the chaos of this particular astral entanglement. You're the Sorceress Supreme, aren't you?\nThis little challenge put Wanda's guard back up. \"So are you, in your world.\"\nRight. And I could probably figure it out through trial and error, over a period of years or decades or centuries back in the material plane. But by then, Dracula will have gotten what he wants from the Darkhold.\nThat name refocused Wanda's attention. She realized where she had tasted the darkness in those whispers before. She released her meditation, holding the link open to the astral projection of the man claiming to be Stephen Strange. \n\"The Darkhold?\" That powerful artifact was gone from Wanda's reality. She had only heard of it. But it contained the kind of knowledge she might be able to use…\nShe knit strands of chaos together into a knot, seized the astral presence of Strange, and wove him into it too.\nWait —\n\"Untie it,\" she said, \"and you will know your way home. And I will also know that you are who you say you are.\"\nHis voice vanished and she waited.\nThe sun had traversed Wundagore's peak and begun its plunge into the western mountains when a portal flared open and Stephen Strange appeared. \nHe was a grander figure than the Strange she had known, mostly because he wore the regalia of the Sorcerer Supreme. She made a mental note to craft garments more fitting of her station…when she had the time. Most of Kamar-Taj had been wiped off the face of the planet ages ago. She had salvaged what she could, but had not thought to include any ritual clothing. \n\"That was quite a little challenge,\" he said.\n\"It was the best way. Can't let just anyone into my Sanctum,\" Wanda answered.\n\"Glad your security is up to snuff,\" he said, a little chuckle under his breath. \"Thank you.\"\n\"You can thank me by telling me what interest Dracula has in the Darkhold. It has not existed in this reality for decades, perhaps longer.\"\n\"You should be grateful for that.\"\n\"Answer my question, Strange.\"\n\"About what Dracula wants? Oh, he thinks the Darkhold contains knowledge of a spell that will let vampires walk in sunlight and turn all humanity into their prey.\"\n\"And does it?\" she asked.\n\"The spells he seeks have that power, though they were designed for other purposes. It was born of darker ambitions than letting bloodsuckers out for a sunny stroll.\"\nThis was true. The Darkhold was crafted by a being she knew all too well. If she could possess it, delve into and master its mysteries, Wanda suspected she could at long last stop the decay of her universe. As Sorceress Supreme, she could wield its power to destroy the forces of magical entropy, end the endless wars between gods and immortals…\n\"Wundagore is not far from Dracula's realm,\" she mused. \"But in this world, his castle has been empty for a long time.\"\n\"In my world, his castle isn't empty,\" Strange said. \"But it also isn't in Transylvania anymore.\"\n\"Oh? Where is it?\"\n\"Central Park.\" \nStrange opened another portal, revealing to her the city of New York, under a full moon. Even through the portal, Wanda could sense the terrible sorcerous corruption pervading the city. Time perverted… \"That moon isn't moving,\" she said.\n\"No,\" Strange said. \"Dracula has already used the Darkhold to imprison New York in an endless night. His power is growing, and there aren't nearly enough powerful people to resist him.\"\n\"But now you can,\" she pointed out.\n\"Ideally, yes,\" Strange said. \"And I will. The resistance is going to need more help, though. The Timestream Entanglement has unleashed forces none of us ever even knew existed. Different histories colliding…\"\n\"Yes, I've seen that.\"\n\"And Chronovium complicates everything further.\"\n\"Chronovium?\"\nStrange looked around Wanda's mountaintop retreat. He spread his hands and swept them back together. Out of nothing, seemingly, a crystal appeared. \"This is what it looks like where I come from,\" he said. \"Though in your reality, it will take a different form.\"\nShe held a hand out and drew the crystal toward her. \"Fascinating,\" she breathed. \"This was created by the entanglement?\"\n\"That's right.\"\n\"How have I not noticed it until now?\"\n\"You've had a lot on your plate keeping this reality from utter annihilation,\" Strange pointed out. \"That chaos bubble takes quite a bit of focus to maintain.\"\nThis was true, but Wanda was still shocked something like Chronovium could permeate her world without her noticing it. \"I seem to have been meditating a little too much,\" she said.\nStrange didn't argue. \n\"It is time I took a more active role in the battles critical to the survival of my reality. I've been leaning too heavily on useful loose cannons,\" she said.\nStrange nodded.\n\"And will you help me, Strange?\"\n\"You give us a hand with Dracula and the Darkhold, I'll be more than happy to bring a little Strange back to your reality.\" He cracked the barest hint of a smile. \n\"The Darkhold,\" she said. \"The list of people who shouldn't have it is long, but Dracula would have to be close to the top.\"\n\"I agree,\" Strange said.\n\"Then let's go take it from him.\"\nThe two Sorcerers Supreme stepped up to the portal. \n\"But before we go,\" Wanda said, \"I think one of those loose cannons might be particularly useful in this New York. After all, the Moon is his guiding light.\" She hoped he was still alive — and not yet completely insane.\n\"Fine, one more for this crazy time travel road trip.\" Strange pocketed the blood-red Chronovium before gesturing to Wanda. \"Lead the way.\"",

Of course he would break down the Tower's walls and come to find me. If I were a creature of muscle and rage, with just enough brain to speak, that is what I would do. And of course at the moment he was seeking his revenge, which he thinks of as protecting Asgard from me, you would make your grand entrance, because even more than me, Hela, you love to be the center of attention.\" Loki spread his arms, taking in the situation. \"Where was I wrong?\"\n\"You betrayed Asgard to Hela?\" Rage nearly blinded Thor. Lightning crackled from Mjölnir, and from Thor's eyes, as the Odinforce rose within him. This was unforgivable treason — again! How many times had Loki done this, or tried to? And now, with the mortal Doctor Doom upending time and space, he was doing it again? \n\"Asgard was always destined to be mine,\" Loki said. \"The All-Father sleeps while the Realms are torn apart by scheming mortals. We do nothing as so-called Heroes blunder through their failed solutions to the problem. I intend to change that. But I cannot do that while you lumber around getting in the way. So.\" He gestured toward the portal. \nWhen Thor looked that way, he saw that the portal had enlarged a hundredfold, and the legions of the dead were upon him.\nThey came in seemingly endless waves, eyes empty and mouths open in snarls of mindless hate. Thor tore great swathes through them with Mjölnir, lightning breaking apart Hela's armies. Asgardians, Dark Elves, trolls of Jotunheim…the denizens of all the Ten Realms came together in Hela's legions, since death alone united every race connected to the World Tree. Thor fought them alone, while Hela and Loki watched, as if he was a gladiator whose life was their entertainment. He shattered them with Mjölnir, annihilated them with lightning, but cawing over Hela's legions were an endless flock of the Nastrond Crows, hellish creatures that Thor's blows could not destroy. They swooped and pecked and clawed, and no matter how Thor struck at them, they reformed from clouds of black feathers and came at him again. \nNo help was coming. Asgard was crippled by fear of Loki. The Valkyrior and the Crimson Hawks were away from the city fighting pointless wars in other realms, another maneuver by Loki to leave the city defenseless. All that stood between Asgard and Hela's legions was Thor himself. So be it, he thought. He would strike them down until he could no longer raise his arm. \nThat time was coming. He slew crows by the thousand and yet their numbers were undiminished. He was still the Odinson, god of thunder…but even gods grew old, and Thor felt the centuries in his bones as he shattered the lava-crusted skeleton of a Muspelheim fire demon and unleashed a blast of lightning that tore a great hole in Hela's ranks reaching across the plaza into the portal itself. If he could only close it…but no, he had not the magic. He would fight until he fell and earn his passage to Valhalla.\nThen, just as Thor had abandoned hope, Hela prolonged his misery. \"I tire of this game,\" she said. With a gesture she dispelled her armies. \nThe sudden silence in the plaza was jarring, broken only by the cawing of Hela's crows, who remained fluttering and squawking over the broad plaza before the Palace of Asgard. One alit on Hela's shoulder as Thor calmed his battle frenzy and turned to face her. If she wanted single combat, he would offer it, but he was tired and Hela's magic was mighty. He had no faith that he would survive, or that Loki would intervene on his behalf.",

The old ways, the old balances, they no longer apply. And you, Thor Odinson, are but a stumbling block, interfering with a new vision of the Ten Realms and beyond.\"\nThor flexed his arms to strike at her, but a powerful enchantment held him fast. Such was her power that he had not seen her make a motion or speak a spell. \n\"The old must make way for the new,\" Hela said. \"And sooner or later, everyone will make way for the dead.\"\nThor could see Loki just behind Hela, looking smug and completely in control as he created a portal from his newly tapped Chronovium. But how long before the trickster understood that Hela was playing her own tricks? The brothers locked eyes. Thor knew Loki could read his expression, even though he could not speak. This is not over, brother. I am coming for you, and when I do, no god or magic in the Ten Realms will save you.\n\"Goodbye, Odinson,\" Hela sneered, her dark power ensnaring him. And with a toss of her glorious hand, Thor was flung on a journey into mystery.\nHe fell from the sky trailing fire, and his impact left a ring of scorched ground a thousand feet across. When Thor stood, the echoes of his landing were still sounding in the dry hills that surrounded him. He was in a desert, with those hills receding in all directions under a sky that glowed an infernal red. He had never seen this place before. It was Midgard, certainly, but not the Earth he knew. Loki's sorcery had flung him very far from home indeed. \nThinking of his brother got Thor moving. Whatever Earth this was, he needed to find allies to accompany him back to Asgard and remove Loki from the throne before Loki's scheming backfired and Hela ruled all the Ten Realms.\nBut where to go…?\nOn the horizon he could see what might be a small city. Lights blazed around a tall tower. He would start there. \nThen he saw something rise up into the sky from near the tower. It grew rapidly, silhouetted against a red sun, and Thor realized it was moving.\nToward him. And very fast.\nHe had just gotten Mjolnir up in front of him when a giant came screaming down out of the sky, smashing Thor into the bottom of a new impact crater. Thor felt his power rebuilding within him, along with his battle fury. He released both in a blow from Mjolnir that knocked the giant back out of the crater. Thor leaped up after him, Mjolnir poised for another blow — and he saw his opponent was none other than the Hulk. But a different Hulk, crackling with vivid green energy and even bigger than the last time Thor had seen him, wearing a belt featuring various lights and devices. \"Banner!\" Thor cried out, dodging a swipe of Hulk's massive fist. \"What sorcery is this?\"\nHulk roared and smashed Thor into the ground again.\nVery well, Thor thought. He knew his one-time ally was prone to unthinking rages when in battle. Sometimes he had to be brought out of them another way. \nHulk's next punch met the head of Mjolnir, swung with all Thor's might. The blast wave from that collision knocked them both sprawling. Thor was up first. He leaped in a high arc over Hulk, coming down to deliver a mighty hammer blow to Hulk's belt. Gamma energy exploded out, searing Thor's eyes and knocking him flat. Dazed, he tried to get to his feet. When he could see again, the monstrous Hulk was gone and Banner sat in the shreds of his clothes and shattered pieces of his belt. \n\"Oh,\" he said. \"Thor.\" He rubbed his face as he stood, and his expression swiftly changed as he registered that it was actually Thor who stood before him. \"Thor! Do you know how long we've been looking for you?\"\nThor didn't know. He didn't know where they were or what Banner was talking about, and he didn't care. All that mattered was Asgard. \"Banner,\" he said, \"I need your help.\"",

He gave a shout, relieved to hear the sound of his voice again.\n\"Brother!\" With its walls shattered, the Tower of Solitude no longer held its enchantments. More quietly than his initial challenge, Thor added, \"You have a surprise in store.\" \nHe flew through the hole, over the city of Asgard and toward the palace. Yggdrasil's roots arched far overhead. Loki had crews at hard labor tapping the World-Tree's sap, which was rich in Chronovium. Thor had no doubt that Loki would cut a deal with the dwarves or anyone else who could use the rich sap to create magical weapons or instruments. If he hadn't already. Chronovium had also transformed Loki's magic, making him even more powerful — but Thor felt it too. It glimmered in the carvings on Mjölnir's Uru head. He felt it even in the Odinforce.\nNow Loki would feel it, too.\nHe shouted out his brother's name, letting the challenge echo across the city. \"Your plan didn't work, brother! You see I'm free!\"\nAnd Loki was there, manifesting in the air just out of Thor's reach. \"On the contrary, brother, my plan is working perfectly. Do you not think I anticipated you would solve this problem the only way you ever solve any problem?\" He smirked. \"That is to say, with brute force?\"\nThe smirk was the opening Thor needed, the single moment of inattention that always got Loki in trouble. He seized Loki and dropped to the ground, smashing his brother into the stones of Asgard's palace plaza. He raised Mjölnir, but Loki stung Thor's hand with a short knife and twisted away.\nHow long had they been inexorably moving toward this moment? Centuries. Tens of centuries. I have tried, Thor thought. I tried to make him feel like one of us. But Loki only ever looks out for Loki, and now — again — Asgard's future hangs in the balance.\n\"I knew you had escaped the Tower before you were all the way through the hole,\" Loki sneered. \"It's always makes me chuckle when you scream ‘Brother' like when we were children.\"\n\"And yet you have answered my call,\" Thor shot back. \"If you could have stopped me, why the charade?\"\n\"Oh, brother,\" Loki said, twisting the word, \"you know I love a charade. And by escaping, you have helped settle a little dispute I was having. You see, a certain someone who may shortly be joining our conversation did not believe you would escape. And now that you have, she will doubtless see the wisdom of my proposed course of action.\"\nAs if he had summoned it, a portal opened.

Loki might have betrayed him and made his devious play for the throne of Asgard, but even Loki could not think of everything.\nBoom.\nIt had not occurred to him, for example, that Thor could call Mjölnir without making a sound.\nBOOM\nMjölnir exploded through the wall of the Tower of Solitude and met Thor's extended hand. He gave a shout, relieved to hear the sound of his voice again.\n\"Brother!\" With its walls shattered, the Tower of Solitude no longer held its enchantments. More quietly than his initial challenge, Thor added, \"You have a surprise in store.\" \nHe flew through the hole, over the city of Asgard and toward the palace. Yggdrasill's roots arched far overhead. Loki had crews at hard labor tapping the World-Tree's sap, which was rich in Chronovium. Thor had no doubt that Loki would cut a deal with the dwarves or anyone else who could use the rich sap to create magical weapons or instruments. If he hadn't already. Chronovium had also transformed Loki's magic, making him even more powerful — but Thor felt it too. It glimmered in the carvings on Mjölnir's Uru head. He felt it even in the Odinforce.\nNow Loki would feel it, too.\nHe shouted out his brother's name, letting the challenge echo across the city. \"Your plan didn't work, brother! You see I'm free!\"\nAnd Loki was there, manifesting in the air just out of Thor's reach. \"On the contrary, brother, my plan is working perfectly. Do you not think I anticipated you would solve this problem the only way you ever solve any problem?\" He smirked. \"That is to say, with brute force?\"\nThe smirk was the opening Thor needed, the single moment of inattention that always got Loki in trouble. He seized Loki and dropped to the ground, smashing his brother into the stones of Asgard's palace plaza. He raised Mjölnir, but Loki stung Thor's hand with a short knife and twisted away.\nHow long had they been inexorably moving toward this moment? Centuries. Tens of centuries. I have tried, Thor thought. I tried to make him feel like one of us. But Loki only ever looks out for Loki, and now — again — Asgard's future hangs in the balance.\n\"I knew you had escaped the Tower before you were all the way through the hole,\" Loki sneered. \"It always makes me chuckle when you scream 'Brother' like when we were children.\"\n\"And yet you have answered my call,\" Thor shot back. \"If you could have stopped me, why the charade?\"\n\"Oh, brother,\" Loki said, twisting the word, \"you know I love a charade. And by escaping, you have helped settle a little dispute I was having. You see, a certain someone who may shortly be joining our conversation did not believe you would escape. And now that you have, she will doubtless see the wisdom of my proposed course of action.\"\nAs if he had summoned it, a portal opened. Through it, Thor saw the unmistakable landscape of Hel, bleak and dark and endless. Hela's legions of dead were on the march, Chronovium glittering in their empty eyes, Hela herself leading them on. Space bent around her, and in the next instant, she had stepped through the portal.\n\"Loki,\" she said. \"I see you let your brother escape.\"\n\"He is more resourceful than he seems,\" Loki said, keeping a wary eye on Thor.\n\"Or you were overconfident?\" Hela countered. \n\"Hardly,\" Loki snapped. \"I have anticipated everything thus far. Of course he would break down the Tower's walls and come to find me. If I were a creature of muscle and rage, with just enough brain to speak, that is what I would do. And of course at the moment he was seeking his revenge, which he thinks of as protecting Asgard from me, you would make your grand entrance, because even more than me, Hela, you love to be the center of attention.\" Loki spread his arms, taking in the situation. \"Where was I wrong?\"\n\"You betrayed Asgard to Hela?\" Rage nearly blinded Thor. Lightning crackled from Mjölnir, and from Thor's eyes, as the Odinforce rose within him. This was unforgivable treason — again! How many times had Loki done this, or tried to? And now, with the mortal Doctor Doom upending time and space, he was doing it again? \n\"Asgard was always destined to be mine,\" Loki said. \"The All-Father sleeps while the Realms are torn apart by scheming mortals. We do nothing as so-called Heroes blunder through their failed solutions to the problem. I intend to change that. But I cannot do that while you lumber around getting in the way. So.\" He gestured toward the portal. \nWhen Thor looked that way, he saw that the portal had enlarged a hundredfold, and the legions of the dead were upon him.\nThey came in seemingly endless waves, eyes empty and mouths open in snarls of mindless hate. Thor tore great swathes through them with Mjölnir, lightning breaking apart Hela's armies. Asgardians, Dark Elves, trolls of Jotunheim…the denizens of all the Ten Realms came together in Hela's legions, since death alone united every race connected to the World Tree. Thor fought them alone, while Hela and Loki watched, as if he was a gladiator whose life was their entertainment. He shattered them with Mjölnir, annihilated them with lightning, but cawing over Hela's legions were an endless flock of the Nastrond Crows, hellish creatures that Thor's blows could not destroy. They swooped and pecked and clawed, and no matter how Thor struck at them, they reformed from clouds of black feathers and came at him again. \nNo help was coming. Asgard was crippled by fear of Loki. The Valkyrior and the Crimson Hawks were away from the city fighting pointless wars in other realms, another maneuver by Loki to leave the city defenseless. All that stood between Asgard and Hela's legions was Thor himself. So be it, he thought. He would strike them down until he could no longer raise his arm. \nThat time was coming. He slew crows by the thousand and yet their numbers were undiminished. He was still the Odinson, god of thunder…but even gods grew old, and Thor felt the centuries in his bones as he shattered the lava-crusted skeleton of a Muspelheim fire demon and unleashed a blast of lightning that tore a great hole in Hela's ranks reaching across the plaza into the portal itself. If he could only close it…but no, he had not the magic. He would fight until he fell and earn his passage to Valhalla.\nThen, just as Thor had abandoned hope, Hela prolonged his misery. \"I tire of this game,\" she said. With a gesture she dispelled her armies. \nThe sudden silence in the plaza was jarring, broken only by the cawing of Hela's crows, who remained fluttering and squawking over the broad plaza before the Palace of Asgard. One alit on Hela's shoulder as Thor calmed his battle frenzy and turned to face her. If she wanted single combat, he would offer it, but he was tired and Hela's magic was mighty. He had no faith that he would survive, or that Loki would intervene on his behalf.\nBut she did not strike him down. \"Thor,\" she said, \"the die is cast. Asgard is Loki's. Your father abandoned it and you could not protect it. Now Loki will.\" With a diabolical smile she added, \"And of course I will offer my own guidance.\"\n\"None of the Realms will survive if you destroy the balance among them,\" Thor said. \"You will bring Ragnarök.\"\n\"No,\" Hela said. \"The universes and the Realms are torn asunder and remade, doomed by those meddling mortals whose names for once speak true. The old ways, the old balances, they no longer apply. And you, Thor Odinson, are but a stumbling block, interfering with a new vision of the Ten Realms and beyond.\"\nThor flexed his arms to strike at her, but a powerful enchantment held him fast. Such was her power that he had not seen her make a motion or speak a spell. \n\"The old must make way for the new,\" Hela said. \"And sooner or later, everyone will make way for the dead.\"\nThor could see Loki just behind Hela, looking smug and completely in control as he created a portal from his newly tapped Chronovium. But how long before the trickster understood that Hela was playing her own tricks? The brothers locked eyes. Thor knew Loki could read his expression, even though he could not speak. This is not over, brother. I am coming for you, and when I do, no god or magic in the Ten Realms will save you.\n\"Goodbye, Odinson,\" Hela sneered, her dark power ensnaring him. And with a toss of her glorious hand, Thor was flung on a journey into mystery.\nHe fell from the sky trailing fire, and his impact left a ring of scorched ground a thousand feet across. When Thor stood, the echoes of his landing were still sounding in the dry hills that surrounded him. He was in a desert, with those hills receding in all directions under a sky that glowed an infernal red. He had never seen this place before. It was Midgard, certainly, but not the Earth he knew. Loki's sorcery had flung him very far from home indeed. \nThinking of his brother got Thor moving. Whatever Earth this was, he needed to find allies to accompany him back to Asgard and remove Loki from the throne before Loki's scheming backfired and Hela ruled all the Ten Realms.\nBut where to go…?\nOn the horizon he could see what might be a small city. Lights blazed around a tall tower. He would start there. \nThen he saw something rise up into the sky from near the tower. It grew rapidly, silhouetted against a red sun, and Thor realized it was moving.\nToward him. And very fast.\nHe had just gotten Mjolnir up in front of him when a giant came screaming down out of the sky, smashing Thor into the bottom of a new impact crater. Thor felt his power rebuilding within him, along with his battle fury. He released both in a blow from Mjolnir that knocked the giant back out of the crater. Thor leaped up after him, Mjolnir poised for another blow — and he saw his opponent was none other than the Hulk. But a different Hulk, crackling with vivid green energy and even bigger than the last time Thor had seen him, wearing a belt featuring various lights and devices. \"Banner!\" Thor cried out, dodging a swipe of Hulk's massive fist. \"What sorcery is this?\"\nHulk roared and smashed Thor into the ground again.\nVery well, Thor thought. He knew his one-time ally was prone to unthinking rages when in battle. Sometimes he had to be brought out of them another way. \nHulk's next punch met the head of Mjolnir, swung with all Thor's might. The blast wave from that collision knocked them both sprawling. Thor was up first. He leaped in a high arc over Hulk, coming down to deliver a mighty hammer blow to Hulk's belt. Gamma energy exploded out, searing Thor's eyes and knocking him flat. Dazed, he tried to get to his feet. When he could see again, the monstrous Hulk was gone and Banner sat in the shreds of his clothes and shattered pieces of his belt. \n\"Oh,\" he said. \"Thor.\" He rubbed his face as he stood, and his expression swiftly changed as he registered that it was actually Thor who stood before him. \"Thor! Do you know how long we've been looking for you?\"\nThor didn't know. He didn't know where they were or what Banner was talking about, and he didn't care. All that mattered was Asgard. \"Banner,\" he said, \"I need your help.\"",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10420000_HeroGalleryInfo_Story_#0_Content": "\"It sure would be easy to be sad,\" thought Peni Parker as she climbed out of the hot springs and got ready for her next patrol. She'd lost her parents, the world had been completely turned upside down because some guy named Doom had scrambled all of time, ruining the \"Web of Life and Destiny\" or whatever, and if that wasn't bad enough, she was in Tokyo and was set to miss every high school event in New York for the next forever. Seriously heavy stuff, but at least she would get to skip finals.\nShe'd also had a lot of time to put her Dad's SP//dr mech through its paces and work in his old lab. It wasn't easy letting herself be bitten by a radioactive spider, but Peni would have done it a hundred times over to be able to follow in her Dad's footsteps. Now, she is linked to SP//dr, fighting bad guys and protecting not just Tokyo, but the entirety of time and space! \nPlus there's this Chronovium stuff everywhere? What even is that? She knew people were after it, but what did it do exactly? She'd run some experiments that suggested it was, like, crystallized time, but that didn't explain much. Next time Peni took SP//dr in for maintenance and upgrades, she planned to spend a little more time figuring out exactly what Chronovium could do.\nLife was a lot better when you focused on the positive. She needed to remind herself of that from time to time, because she spent a lot of her time fighting a whole slew of weirdos from other timelines that probably didn't even know they were threatening the collapse of all of time and space. Or were they? Those details weren't always clear to Peni, but she loved hearing the Master Weaver and his apprentice, Spider-Zero, argue about it. And she knew that when push came to shove — as it often had since the Timestream Entanglement — she and SP//dr would defend the Web, even on mundane patrol missions like the one she was starting just now.\nThat meant defending both the Master Weaver and Spider-Zero, who were always so preoccupied with mending and weaving that they pretty much never noticed when they were about to be attacked. \nLike right now. \nA single Doombot angled toward the Nexus at the heart of the Web of Life and Destiny. The Master Weaver never noticed it. Peni did, though, and she had a plan. \"SP//dr, are you thinking what I'm thinking?\"\nSP//dr was. \nPeni tensed, and SP//dr leapt away from the Web strand she'd been sitting on, falling toward the Doombot. She had to time this just right, or it would be a long fall to the ground somewhere in Shinjuku. SP//dr might be able to handle the fall, but the shock of landing wouldn't do Peni any good. \nBut her timing, as it turned out, was perfect. The Doombot noticed her far too late, just as she had shot her own webs out from SP//dr's spinnerets and used a Web strand to snap her around in a long arc. The Doombot barely turned around when SP//dr slammed into it feet-first. Sparks shot from its chassis and bits of armor plating stuck to nearby stands of the Web as the Doombot tumbled away into the neon-speckled darkness below. \nPeni finished off the maneuver with a perfect, thruster-assisted double somersault that landed her on an upper strand of the Web, close enough to the Nexus where she could see both the Master Weaver and Spider-Zero. They were talking, and Peni didn't want to interrupt, so she hung upside down, just because, until Spider-Zero headed out onto one of the Web's strands, making little repairs as she went. Peni noticed Spider-Zero removing stuck bits of Doombot armor on her way, and felt a little guilty — but hey, she'd done what a hero had to do. Protect the Web!\nStill, did Doom — either Doom — ever run out of those things?\n\"I suspect not,\" a familiar voice said by her side, and Peni jumped. It was the Master Weaver.\n\"Hey,\" Peni said. \"Did you just read my mind?\"\n\"Not exactly. I sensed certain vibrations in the Web, and they suggested to me what you were thinking.\"\n\"Right.\" Peni said. \"Same diff. Hey, I've been meaning to ask you. I've been doing some experiments in my Dad's lab — my lab now — and Chronovium, wow, what is that stuff, anyway?\"\n\"Here, it has become part of the Web,\" the Master Weaver replied. \"But all things are ultimately part of the Web.\"\nWhich was a super Master Weaver-like thing to say, but didn't really bring a lot of clarity to the situation? \nBefore Peni could rephrase the question, the Master Weaver had passed on to another part of the Web. She decided to take the same question to Spider-Zero. \nAlso, she wanted to know if anybody knew when Doom was going to attack the Web himself. That seemed like a near-certainty, since there were just about always Doombots around, but nobody ever wanted to talk about it. Peni didn't know whether that was because they didn't know, or didn't want to tell her because she was a kid, or some other stupid reason, but she felt pretty strongly that Doom attacking the Web was a logical next step for him. Either of them. They had to be ready!\nAs she approached Spider-Zero, Peni was baffled to see the Weaver's apprentice doing something with...paper? At this distance it was hard to tell. She vaulted over onto another strand, then another, zigzagging until she got close enough to Spider-Zero that she could see Spider-Zero dropping little pieces of Chronovium into some of the portals that existed around the Nexus. The Chronovium in the Web was kind of sticky, and it looked like Spider-Zero was...yeah, she was writing something on pieces of paper and then sticking those pieces of paper to Chronovium?\n\"Hey!\" Peni called when she was close enough. \"What are you writing?\"\n\"A message to another version of myself,\" Spider-Zero said.\n\"How do you know where to find other versions of yourself?\"\n\"That's part of what the Master Weaver is teaching me,\" Spider-Zero said. \"I can listen in on an infinite number of other worlds and futures. Sometimes I can even...\" She made a conducting motion with both hands. \"Influence them a little.\"\n\"So you could do something about Doom? Or the Timestream Entanglement!\" Peni's thoughts drifted to maybe even saving her father, but she couldn't bring herself to say it. Was it even possible? And if he came back, would Peni just be a regular person again? It would be worth it.\nSpider-Zero was watching her, as if she could see the emotional tug-of-war going on inside Peni's mind. \"Well...possibly. But that is, if you'll forgive the expression, a very tangled web. Tugging on one strand will have all kinds of unpredictable effects. I wouldn't take any action until I've had more time to trace the path of each strand.\"\n\"How much time?\"\n\"Dunno, more than we've got with so much happening.\"\n\"Okay, so anyway, there are more Doombots climbing the Web to get you and the Master Weaver.\" Peni had just spotted them, jetting upward from the ground.\nSpider-Zero looked down. \"Uh huh,\" she said. She scribbled something on a piece of paper and stuck it to a bit of Chronovium. Then she pushed that through a tiny portal that opened briefly, like a soap bubble, by her hand. The minute she pushed the message through, the portal was gone. \nA split second after that, all three Doombots were gone too, swallowed up by a larger version of that portal that appeared around them and then blinked out of existence.\n\"Whoa,\" Peni said. \"That's definitely cooler than what I did.\"\n\"Oh, it's not a competition,\" Spider-Zero said. \"We all protect the Web in our own ways.\"\n\"Speaking of that,\" Peni said, \"you guys know that sooner or later Doom is going to get sick of sending Doombots and when he does, he'll show up to finish the job himself?\"\n\"Wouldn't surprise me,\" Spider-Zero said.\n\"So should we, like, maybe be doing something about it?\"\n\"What makes you think we aren't?\"\nPeni groaned. \"You sound more and more like the Weaver every day.\"\nSpider-Zero smiled. \"He's teaching me a lot. You too, I think. You've grown a lot since you started protecting the Web.\"\nThis had Peni feeling pretty good about herself until she looked up and saw Spider-Zero right there next to her. \"I have to repair that,\" Spider-Zero said, pointing at the dangling strands of the Web Peni had accidentally snapped while fighting the Doombot.\n\"I had to!\" Peni protested.\n\"I know,\" Spider-Zero said. \"I'm not angry. I just have to repair the Web. That's what I do. That's who I am. And without the Web —\"\nIt was Peni's turn to say, \"I know.\" After the Timestream Entanglement, the Web was more important than ever. It wasn't just the Dooms they had to worry about, but any other dimension-hopping villain or creature might appear at any moment to destroy the Web or the Weaver — or they might try to destroy Tokyo, or Japan, or the world, or all worlds! \nBut none of that was going to happen while Peni Parker was on patrol. That should be a banner, she thought: PENI PARKER ON PATROL! How cool would it be to have her own banner that followed her around, and maybe her own sound effects. A synthesized soundtrack! Even better. She started composing the tune in her head as SP//dr leapt and climbed among the endless strands of the Web. Soon enough, she had Spider-Zero back where she belonged. \nShe looked down on the city, then up at the vastness of the Web and the universes beyond it. \"I wish my father could have seen this.\"\n\"My father is also dead,\" Spider-Zero said, pausing for a moment in her work. \"But I think he would be proud of the work I do. Same for you.\"\nWell, that gave Peni a little twinkle in her heart. This hero business wasn't just about the fights. It could make you feel good sometimes too.",

Makes it easier to find parts, at least. \nThat's what Rocket was supposed to be doing, and maybe Groot too, but Quill wasn't too sure about Groot. He had kind of wandered off in the direction of the jungle that bordered the ship graveyard. For all Quill knew, he was communing with the local daisies and dahlias.\nQuill hoped Groot wasn't anywhere close to the fire spreading through the ship graveyard. The flames weren't coming close to the Milano thankfully, which had churned up a good furrow of earth and scrap metal during its highly controlled and perfectly executed emergency landing. So, since he had pulled off a perfect landing after Rocket had screwed something up, Quill thought he should probably congratulate himself for making sure the Milano wasn't going to be burned by creating an excellent firebreak behind it. Not that Rocket would ever give him credit, nor would Groot ever notice. \n\"Man,\" Quill said. \"It's not easy being a leader.\"\nHe said this while sighting down the barrel of one Element Gun at an approaching symbiote. This was the downside of crashing in a spaceship graveyard on the planet Klyntar. Lots of symbiotes who showed up to the new crash site with an appetite. He was picking them off as fast as he could, but even Star-Lord could only take them down so fast, and more and more of them showed up with each passing second. Quill was starting to resent Rocket for crashing the ship in the first place. On the other hand, what good did that do? Now Rocket was looking for parts, which was the right thing to do if he wanted to make up for his mistake. Accountability, Quill believed, was a big part of successful teamwork. \nHe picked off a trio of symbiotes crawling over the top of a huge amalgam of Skrull ship parts just to the north of the Milano. He had seen some of these critters on Earth and elsewhere in the galaxy, but not like these. Apparently if they bonded to humans, they became sort of human? But these, hoo boy, they were bonded to all kinds of aliens that even Peter Quill, who had been to more planets than he'd had hot meals, could recognize. And none of them seemed to like humans very much, to judge from how they kept trying to claw or chomp or shred him. \nAn alert went off inside the Milano around him. Quill dropped into the ship just in time to catch a symbiote coming up through the hatch. He popped it with both Element Guns, but not before it had gotten all the way in and wrapped a barbed tentacle around his leg. Swearing in a every language he knew, he blew the tentacle apart and limped over to slam the hatch shut. His leg hurt like a flerkin's kiss on the way back up to the top of the Milano's hull, but pain had to wait. Quill was going to protect his ship to the end. \nA big explosion lit up the far end of the ship graveyard, over by a cluster of ancient buildings that rose up from the edge of the jungle. Looks like the fire's reached a ship with something combustible on board, Quill thought. Bits of flaming wreckage rained down around the buildings and nearer to the edge of the jungle.\nMost of the symbiotes abandoned their siege of the Milano and took off toward the fire, which suited Quill just fine. It was a whole lot easier to fix a spaceship when you didn't have a horde of monsters trying to eat you, or whatever they were trying to do. He shot at them a little more while they were running off, then tried to get a hold of Rocket on the comm. Interference responded, which could have been background radiation, or some weird emission from the massive Celestial corpse floating around in near-Klyntar orbit, or anything else, really. Rocket was incommunicado, and Groot, well, Quill never knew how to get in touch with Groot.\nGuess I'll keep working until they came back, he thought as he watched the fire for a minute to see whether it was coming his way. When it wasn't, he went below to see what he could do about getting this bucket of bolts back into orbit.\nA couple of hours later, he was putting the finishing touches on his work when he heard noises from a nearby wreck. He scrambled up to the top of the Milano's hull and pointed Element Guns in that general direction — but instead of more symbiotes, he saw Rocket scrambling over the wrecked ships, with Groot right behind him. \n\"Quill!\" Rocket shouted. \"Give us a hand!?\" Groot was carrying a huge armload of scrap tech just behind the raccoon. \n\"What, you took some time to go scavenging?\" Quill asked. \"What is all this garbage?\"\n\"It's not garbage, you flarkin' dolt,\" Rocket said. \"We fought like a hundred million of those monsters to get it, and now this scut is gonna get us out of here.\"\n\"Oh, I got that figured out already,\" Quill said. \"Everything's all tuned up in the engines, except for —\"\nRocket was already looking. \"Except you don't have any shielding over the plasma exchangers.\"\nQuill pointed out at the wrecks. \"Plenty of shielding out there, genius.\"\n\"And how were you going to get enough thrust to get us off-planet if you diverted all the power to the hyperspace drive?\" Rocket put one hand over his eyes, dropping some of his various bits he collected. Quill was used to Rocket thinking he was dumb. It was part of their relationship now. But this time, he had an answer. He pointed up.\n\"What?\" Rocket demanded.\nQuill stabbed a finger toward the sky.\nRocket looked.\n\"See that?\" Quill prompted him. \"The dead Celestial, orbiting in pieces up there?\"\n\"Yeah, I see it,\" Rocket said. \"So what?\"\n\"I am Groot,\" Groot said.\n\"That's right,\" Quill said. \"Slingshot. See, the reason I routed all of the power to the hyperspace drive is that we can do a quantum-displaced slingshot with the Celestial's remains. They come down, the Milano goes up, we make the hyperjump out of here, and we never have to come back to this hellhole ever again. Then we can repair the regular thrusters whenever we get around to it.\"\n\"You're kidding,\" Rocket said. \"Gravity slingshot with the remains of a Celestial? That won't work, you know how many conditions need to be —.\"\n\"Not since we got that Nega-Energy Replicator from that doozy of a deal on Hala. And take a look!\" Quill spread his arms. \"Rocket, old pal, tell me what else we need that we can't find here.\" \nRocket was looking at Quill's work again, this time with a more appraising eye. \"Uh huh,\" he said. \"Quill, you've had a lot of scuzzy ideas in our time, but this one ain't half bad.\"\n\"As compliments go, that's pretty weak, but coming from you, I'll take it. Plus, it has the added benefit of raining Celestial pieces down on these symbiotes, who I have to say are not so good with hospitality.\"\n\"I am Groot.\" His massive companion dropped the junk in his arms and put a kind hand on his shoulder.\nQuill nodded at Groot, then shot Rocket a look. \"Now that was a real compliment.\"\n\"Only problem is,\" Rocket said, \"if you don't have some kind of force dampening matrix powered up when you fire your slingshot, we'll all get to orbit in pieces. But that's totally cool, because I just so happen to have — by which I mean Groot just so happened to have dropped — a piece of equipment that will do the job.\"\n\"What?\" Incredulous, Quill looked from Rocket to Groot and back. \"How did you —?\"\n\"How did I know? I didn't.\" Rocket guffawed. \"I totally got it for another reason, but it will work here.\"\n\"I am Groot,\" Groot said.\n\"You had help from a friendly vine?\" Quill echoed. \"Sorry, Groot, but that's the most far-fetched thing I've heard since we got here. Nothing about this planet is friendly.\"\n\"I am Groot.\"\nQuill turned to Rocket. \"Seriously?\"\n\"I saw it,\" Rocket said. \"The vine helped him. Groot's a diplomat, if you didn't know.\"\nQuill chose not process that idea at this moment, when a horde of symbiotes might show up again at any moment while they were trying to use the orbiting remains of a Celestial as a quantum anchor to slingshot themselves into orbit. \n\"I...okay,\" he said. \"Groot's a diplomat and you just happened to pick up the one piece of equipment I didn't think of that's going to save all our lives while I was busy holding off a hundred thousand million symbiotes to get our ship ready for its possibly final voyage.\" Quill waited, hoping he sounded appropriately frustrated.\nBut either Rocket had missed the sarcasm, or just didn't care, because all he said was, \"Lucky, right? Here, let's get it hooked up.\"\nQuill sighed. For the second time that day, he was thinking about how hard it was to be a leader.",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10450010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "More than two thirds of the planet's surface is covered in water. One might think that those seemingly endless ocean depths would be far more than any single man could rule. But when that single man is Namor, the sovereign of seven seas, there is always room to expand the empire.\nWhile his throne sat in the kingdom of Talocan, it was Namor who united the various other undersea civilizations — from Atlantis to Lemuria — under his reign. Millions of sea-breathing soldiers and countless creatures of the deep all bowed in his presence and answered his every command. But still, Namor craved more. And he knew where to find it. \nMost of his people had only known a life beneath the waves, but Namor was a man of two worlds. True, it had been years since he had lived amongst the surface dwellers, but there was no denying that part of him yearned to feel the air in his lungs and the sun on his skin once more. But in order to do so, he would first have to deal with one of the greatest threats that the Earth had ever known: humankind itself. \nUnlike Namor's seafaring subjects, who lived in harmony with their undersea environment, the humans who lived on the land above had proven themselves to be a danger to the planet time and again. Their careless ways were poisoning the water that Namor's people breathed and threatening to bring the oceans themselves to a boil. Their own scientists had warned that it wouldn't be long before the seas began to rise. But if Namor had his way, the people who inhabited those seas would rise even sooner! \nFor years, Namor had been planning an all-out assault on the surface world in order to claim it as his own. Now, the time had finally come to act, before it was too late. Plans had been laid, and the first battle for control of the land was set to take place on a gem of the Pacific — Jeju Island. But even with his vast army at his back, Namor knew that there were those on the surface who would stand in his way and prevent him from seizing total dominion. Beings with great power who believed themselves to be the Earth's champions. \nIf he truly hoped to stand a chance against these arrogant air breathers, Namor knew he had to make a strategic alliance with a select few of them. Thus, Namor chose to accept the invitation of an old ally and decided to pay a visit to another island before setting foot on Jeju. As the drums of war reverberated through the cold depths, the king of the seas set his course for the island of Krakoa — home of the Mutants.\nGetting to Krakoa was not as easy as simply swimming to shore, though. The sentient island had recently been swept up in a chronal tempest and transported to a distant future. But thanks to the gift of a simple seed that he had planted in the silt at the bottom of the ocean, Namor was able to grow a gateway that delivered him across dimensional barriers and into the shallows off the Krakoan coastline. \nAs he emerged from the water, Namor found a group of emissaries awaiting his arrival. Amongst them were two respected Mutant leaders: the weather manipulator called Storm and the teleporting sorceress known as Magik. At the front of the group stood the man who had extended the invitation to Namor — the Mutant Master of Magnetism known as Magneto. \n\"I was not sure you would be coming,\" Magneto said, sweeping his cape aside with a regal motion as he gestured for Namor to come ashore. \n\"How could I resist such an exclusive form of travel?\" Namor replied. \"It is not every day that one can swim through a circle of kelp and arrive almost a century in the future.\" \n\"A journey few will ever have the chance to experience,\" mused Magneto. \"One reserved only for our people. For Mutants.\"\n\"I would think carefully before you choose to claim me as one of your own, old friend,\" Namor said.\n\"Krakoa does not lie,\" Magneto said, undeterred by Namor's warning. \"If you could cross through the gates, you are indeed one of us. Your genetics are unique — an anomaly compared to both races that spawned you. Like each and every one of us who calls Krakoa home, you are something more. Something superior.\"\n\"I have been telling people that for decades,\" Namor laughed. \"If only they had listened...\" \n\"I know that look in your eyes all too well, Namor,\" Magneto said, his stoic gaze revealing the slightest hint of concern. \"It is the look of a man who is about to make sure his foes start listening… by any means necessary…\"\n\"If you know me as you claim, then you are fully aware of my longstanding quarrel with humanity,\" Namor said. \"They have plundered the planet's resources and have polluted its splendor. They are a cancer that must be wiped from existence if my people are to survive.\"\n\"As we have established, we are your people as well,\" Storm chimed in, \"and we have always believed that peaceful coexistence is the key to survival.\"\n\"I am well aware of Charles Xavier's grand delusions,\" Namor said with a smirk. \"How are those dreams of his working out for you? Last I checked, isolating your entire race on a secluded island is certainly peaceful, but a far cry from coexistence.\"\nStorm's eyes began to crackle with lightning at Namor's insolent words. Without a moment's hesitation, Magneto stepped forward, strategically positioning himself between his most trusted ally and their distinguished guest.  \n\"We have forged a proud Mutant nation here on Krakoa\" Magneto calmly retorted. \"And while the humans still occasionally prove to be thorns in our sides, we have managed to build relationships with them that have proven to be mutually beneficial.\" \n\"For now,\" Namor said, \"until they find yet another justification for unleashing their killing machines upon your populace.\"\n\"If you're looking for a war,\" said Magik, extending the blade of her fabled Soulsword in Namor's direction, \"I happen to know a few in other dimensions that are worth fighting. There's no need to start one of your own.\"\n\"I did not start this conflict,\" Namor said, his eyes narrowing, \"but the king of the seas shall finish it, with or without your aid. So swears Namor!\"\nWith that, Namor turned and began to wade back into the shallows lapping at Krakoa's shore. But he stopped for a moment as Magneto offered one last thought. \n\"We respect your plight, Namor,\" Magneto said, \"and we will not stand idly by as your people are endangered. You are one of us, and Mutants take care of their own. Should you need us, we will stand by your side.\"\nNamor smiled. Perhaps a moment too soon. \n\"But be wary,\" Magneto continued. \"I have witnessed genocide firsthand and I will not allow it to be perpetrated again. Not even against the humans. And certainly not by one of our own. On Krakoa, we live by a simple rule: Murder no man. You would be wise to heed it…\"\nNamor and Magneto locked eyes for a tense moment. Then, the king of the seas dove back into the ocean without a word, swimming with tremendous speed back through the gateway that brought him to the isle of the Mutants.\nAs Namor sat on his throne pondering his next move, Magneto's warning echoed in his head, drowning out the cold silence of the ocean floor. It had already been clear that the impending battle against the humans would not be an easy one. Now, Namor would have to be even more cautious if he wished not to add another race of air breathers to his list of enemies. \nBut though Namor had always been many things — warrior and Mutant and king — cautious had never been one of them. \n\"Gather our greatest warriors,\" Namor said to his most trusted advisors. \"Summon the most ferocious beasts of the sea. Today, we bring humanity to its knees. Today, we claim Jeju Island in the name of Talocan. And tomorrow, if need be, Krakoa shall follow!\"",

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10460_Story_#0_Content": "In the beginning, there was darkness. \nThe universe was no more than an endless void — a vast expanse of silent nothingness — until celestial forces shaped the stars and nurtured life into being. \nJust as the universe began in darkness, so did I. Created within a protective cocoon from which I burst forth, fully-formed. A golden guardian designed to bring peace to the galaxy with my vast cosmic might. But there is a cycle to life. And just as I was born from this cocoon, now I have returned to it, much sooner than I could have anticipated. \nMy cosmic awareness sensed that something was amiss — a great disturbance in the fabric of time and space itself. As multiple realities and timelines became entangled, I reflexively shielded myself within this protective shell. If I truly hoped to fulfill my ultimate purpose, then I would have to bide my time and build my strength for the trials ahead. But what would they be? Even with my deep connection to the primal forces of the universe, I was both literally and figuratively in the dark once more.\nAs I slumbered within my restorative sheath, it became a wayward vessel floating through the cosmos. I was no longer in control of my own destiny, merely a passenger adrift on the currents of fate. The silence out among the stars brought a sense of tranquility I had not experienced since before my birth. The serenity would not last long. \n\"Adam.\" \nA voice called my name, echoing not in my ears, but inside of my mind. Whoever was calling me was reaching out across the void with a psyche even more powerfully attuned than my own. \n\"We are not so different, you and I,\" the voice continued. \"We both slumber while the Multiverse burns around us. Some gods we are...\"\nAs the powerful words pulsed within my brain, an image began to form in my mind's eye. A man confined to a sacred chamber. Not quite a cocoon like my own — his was nearly as old as time itself — yet similar in many ways. The bearded man within was frail and weak, devoid of power. But he was not always so. As my mind was flooded with brief glimpses of his storied past, it became clear that he was once a mighty king that ruled a glorious realm for centuries on end. \n\"Time is something I have never feared,\" he said inside of my mind. \"Not until now. Time and space are twisting around us, and I am trapped here within the Odinsleep, unable to do a Bor-damned thing about it.\"\nThe Odinsleep? Of course! I knew the voice was familiar, even if the man himself no longer was. It belonged to the All-Father of Asgard, Mighty Odin. Had he fallen to the same forces that had caused me to reflexively retreat into my cocoon? \n\"Nay,\" Odin replied, reading my own thoughts, \"I was brought low by the machinations of my own son—the trickster known as Loki. The foul child has usurped the throne of Yggsgard and is set to destroy our proud legacy for his own selfish ends yet again.\" \nDid he say... Yggsgard? How curious. But the proper name of his realm was the least of my concerns. While the rage that the All-Father felt about his son's actions was palpable, there was something more beneath it. A deep concern that spanned far beyond the realm he once ruled. \n\"You too are preparing for a battle when you awaken, golden one,\" Odin said. \"And while my son may indeed test your mettle, he is naught but a distraction from your true enemy. There is a darkness in the cosmos, Adam — one far deeper than that of our slumbers. I have felt it trying to creep its way into my realm. Even into my own dreams. Should it be set loose, I fear that it will corrupt all it touches, snuffing out the starts themselves until nothing remains.\" \nWhat could he be speaking of? I called out to Odin for an answer, but his voice had muted to nothing more than a distant echo. As my cocoon drifted far past the embattled realm of Yggsgard, I left a small fraction of my soul's energy behind with the sleeping Odin — a hint of light to keep the darkness he spoke of at bay. I prayed it would be enough. \nNow that my cosmic awareness had been fully awakened, I could sense another empire on the horizon. This one was not nearly as ancient as Odin's realm, yet its own god seemed just as eager to call my name. \n\"Warlock,\" she said with a growl of disdain. \"You have come a long way to die.\"\nWas I being threatened merely for passing through this space? How rude. \n\"The Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda shall not harm you, traveler,\" the voice continued. \"But those beyond our borders will not be nearly as kind. Of that, you have Bast's word.\"\nBast. The panther goddess. A member of the Orisha, a pantheon of deities worshipped by the people of Wakanda. But last I recalled, Wakanda was merely a nation on the planet Earth, not an interstellar civilization. Could I have drifted into another reality? \n\"More precisely,\" Bast interrupted, \"other realities have drifted to you. This Timestream Entanglement has brought us together from across a multitude of plains. What is left of each universe is converging into one, as if we have been gathered...\"\nGathered? For what...?\n\"For the feast.\"\nAs Bast snarled her final words into my mind, it became clear that her divine presence had somehow been corrupted. Could she have been tainted by the very same darkness that Odin had warned me of? I had no way of knowing, as my journey across the spaceways had already continued deeper into the heart of this strange patchwork galaxy. \n\"Child of the light,\" a third voice suddenly echoed within me. \nThis one I could identify without hesitation. It spoke with such raw power that it could only belong to a Celestial — an ancient being spawned at the dawn of time. But yet, even though its words passed through my consciousness with tremendous force, they were softer than other Celestials I had encountered. Muted. Faded. Like distant memories. \n\"You would be wise to listen, lest my fate end up being yours as well,\" the Celestial implored, though I had little choice to give it anything less than my undivided attention. \n\"As you know, we Celestials were born at the beginning of all that is,\" it continued, \"but we were not the first. There was a primordial force that came before us. A creature of pure darkness, so powerful that he could strike down any who threatened to shed light upon the endless oblivion he ruled.\"\nEven the Celestials themselves? I struggled to imagine a foe so formidable... \n\"Few can wrap their minds around his nihility. And yet, here I am, slain by his sword, with nothing left of me but an empty husk and the echoes of consciousness.\"\nBut there was more than just the remains of a fallen Celestial in the void beyond my cocoon. I could sense that now. There was also a hint of corruption, not unlike the one that had tainted Bast. But this was not found in the disembodied mind of the slaughtered Celestial. Rather, it lingered on the great being's lifeless body, like an infected sore that had been festering for millennia. \n\"You feel him, too,\" the voice echoed. \"His tainted touch has stained my corpse for eons. But now, as time collapses around us, he has awoken once more, eager to revel in the oncoming oblivion. I have called out to others like you — great cosmic forces, ancient warriors, even the gods themselves — for help in containing his eternal blackness, but they have either retreated... or succumbed to his poison. Perhaps you will fare better... \"\nHoping the Celestial was right, I reached out with my mind, desperate to identify the source of this cosmic impurity. But my thoughts became clouded as I heard the Celestial scream a final warning. \n\"Beware, child of light! He has found you!\"\nWho? Who has found me? The Celestial did not answer. But another voice did, with a tone a thousand times darker than the blackness within my cocoon.\n\"Knull.\"\nAs he spoke his own name, I could feel his dark tendrils digging into my mind. This ruler of the void — this King in Black — had awakened somewhere, and was dragging me towards him. Try as I might, I could not escape his grip. \n\"Do not give up hope, child,\" the Celestial said, its voice rapidly fading. \"You will not be alone...\" \nSuddenly, a burst of cosmic fire erupted through the heavens, producing a flash so brilliant that it permeated the walls of my cocoon. The light lasted only a second, but its unusual shape forever burned itself into my mind — a majestic bird, its flaming wings spanning across the cosmos. Before I could process what had happened, the vessel that was meant to protect me now hurtled through space towards a destination unknown. \nMy body was still confined, but my mind was in a heightened state. Where there had once been blinding light, now darkness and despair had slithered their way in. I was overcome with images of the horrors that Knull had once committed, and those he had yet to unleash upon the universe. I could see his past and his future... but what of his present? That, it seemed, was shrouded in mystery — a void greater than Knull himself. \nSuddenly, my journey across the galaxy came to a violent end as my vessel made impact against a most unusual surface. Was this a planet? No... I could feel it writhing around me, as if it were alive. And more, I could feel Knull's sinister presence, closer than ever. Wherever I was, he was as well. \nBefore my cocoon could be dragged beneath the churning sea of oblivion surrounding it, a single crack appeared above me. Where before there was nothing, now there was the faintest glow. The faintest hope. I pushed through, emerging from my cocoon to gaze upon the surface of a world teeming with alien life. \nAnd as my mind touched their hivemind, it all became clear. This was Klyntar, the planet of the symbiotes. It was here that Knull was once worshipped as a god. It was here that his own followers imprisoned him eons ago. And it was here that he was biding his time, regaining his strength, in hopes to break free and claim his prize once more. \nPerhaps he had dragged me here to snuff out my light before it could drown out his shadows. But he made a grave miscalculation:\nI broke free first. And as I stood upon Knull's planet-sized prison, I made a solemn vow to do anything in my power to make sure that his infinite blackness would not go unchecked. \nIn the beginning, there was darkness. \nBut in the end, there will be light. \nAnd I shall be the one to help it shine.

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10470_Story_#0_Content": "As Jeff the Land Shark swam another lap around his small glass enclosure, frustration finally began to settle in. He had tried so hard to stay his usual optimistic self, even after he lost track of how long he had been held captive here inside this strange Theme Park created by the enigmatic Elder of the Universe known as the Collector.\nJeff didn't really know how he got here in the first place. One second, he was frolicking in the endless waves lapping at the California coast with his BFF Gwen. The next, he was here, trapped within a tiny tank that he couldn't seem to chomp his way out of, no matter how wide he opened his powerful, little jaws. \nBut since his unexpected arrival, Jeff had pieced together why he was here. Surrounding his own enclosure were countless other holding cells, each containing unique specimens of lifeforms he had never seen before. Some almost looked like the human friends he had made back home, but others were so bizarre and alien that they couldn't possibly have lived on the land or beneath the waves of his native world. Jeff had visited a zoo before with another of his friends, the archer called Kate. And now, he thought that he was probably in one — just another exhibit on display in an intergalactic menagerie on the edge of the known universe.\nJeff didn't love being confined in his tank, but he had taken some comfort in the fact that he wasn't here alone. And while none of the other creatures around him seemed to be fluent in landshark, there was one fellow captive whose thoughts Jeff could hear in his own head. She said her name was Mantis and that she was a friend. And if there's one thing that Jeff loved — other than devouring everything in his path — it was new friends!\nBut one thing that Jeff hated was when those friends were in trouble... which brings us back to why Jeff had suddenly lost his cheerful demeanor in the first place. Jeff had felt Mantis's psionic scream as she was removed from her cell and dragged away. He had heard the guards talking about taking her to some sort of arena where the Collector's prisoners were forced to fight for their lives against multi-dimensional variants of themselves. Jeff had no idea what any of that meant. But he did know that Mantis was in trouble. He couldn't hear her voice in his head anymore. He couldn't feel her calming presence. He couldn't see where she was or if she was safe. And that made Jeff mad!\nJeff began to swim frenzied circles in his tank, increasing his speed by swishing his tail and paddling his tiny legs as fast as he could. When he had built up enough momentum, he propelled himself toward the wall that separated him from freedom. But the only result was sharp pain as his sweet little face smooshed against the crystal clear wall. Not even the slightest chip or crack could be seen in the glass... though a few may have been left behind in his teeth. It was clear that Jeff would need another plan if he wanted to escape. \nAs he floated there, dazed from the impact, Jeff wondered what his friends back home would do if they were in his situation. Kate would probably use an explosive arrow. Gwen would find an unexpected way to break through a wall (probably the fourth one). Elsa would have hidden some ancient enchanted blade in her ponytail to slice through the impenetrable glass. And Wade would simply sweet talk the guards into letting him out, winning their favor with false promises of money and tacos. None of those options would work for Jeff. He was stuck here, and the thoughts of his lost friends — including Mantis — left him feeling more and more alone with every second that passed. \nBut then he sensed it. A familiar tingle in his brain. Mantis was alive! And she was coming back... for him! Jeff couldn't help but grin as his friend approached, flashing several rows of serrated teeth in her direction. This was the first time he had seen Mantis in person, but while he may not have known her face, he immediately recognized her mind. Now that mind was clearly focused on one thing only — escaping from captivity once and for all. \n\"MMMRRRRR!!!!\"\n\"He's going to draw the guards,\" another voice said. \nIn all his excitement, Jeff hadn't even noticed that Mantis was not alone. She had another humanoid with her, this one far more dark and brooding in demeanor. She did not look nearly as happy to see Jeff as Mantis did. And, to be honest, Jeff wasn't convinced that he liked her much either. \n\"Mrrr?\" Jeff grunted quizzically, noticing the way the second woman was looking at him. He felt as though she was sizing him up, preparing to strike him down the second there was no longer any glass between them. \n\"Don't mind her,\" Mantis said as she started to activate the release mechanism on the side of Jeff's enclosure. \"She wants to get out of here as badly as we do. And she knows the only way we can make that happen is if we work together.\" \nJeff smiled at Mantis, and she smiled back. Despite the fact that they were attempting to break out of the Collector's exhibition, with no real idea how to escape or where they would go if they did get free, there was something about this humanoid that made Jeff feel like everything was going to be all right. And it was clear he had the same effect on her. \nMantis continued to fiddle with the latch on Jeff's tank just as a squadron of armed guards came into view. As the guards shouted something in an alien language, Jeff could sense that Mantis was already reaching out with her mind in hopes of diverting them. But as quick as Mantis's thoughts were, somehow their new friend managed to get to the Collector's crew first. Her blades flashed in a glittering dance, and in seconds, the guards were down for the count. Jeff couldn't have been more impressed. \n\"Mrrr,\" Jeff said, trying to express his appreciation to the purple-haired warrior. Her cold gaze never softened. Jeff could sense that her mind was powerful, just like Mantis's, but her thoughts and emotions were heavily guarded. Jeff wanted his newest friend to like him as much as Mantis did, but for now he would simply have to accept that she no longer seemed to want to kill him or leave him behind. \nMantis finally managed to swing open the door of Jeff's tank, releasing a flood of water into the hallway. Jeff emerged from the miniature wave it created, propping himself up on his stubby legs and giving his body a quick shake to expel the excess moisture from his skin. Mantis laughed with pure delight as a deluge of droplets rained down on her. The other woman was not nearly as amused. \n\"Let's go,\" Mantis said, beckoning to her unlikely pair of partners. She began to run through the Collector's menagerie with a determination that made Jeff believe she knew where she was going. The warrior woman stayed close at Mantis's side, so Jeff felt the best thing to do was bound along right behind them.\nAs Mantis and her companion forged ahead, Jeff suddenly found himself distracted by an unusual smell. It was unlike anything he had ever encountered before, either on land or in the sea. It smelled delicious... and powerful...\nBefore he realized what he was doing, Jeff had veered off from his companions, entering the Collector's private gallery. Here, the Elder of the Universe had gathered some of the most powerful items and artifacts in all of existence and was displaying them for his wealthiest patrons to gaze upon. Jeff didn't know what any of these strange things were. Not the six colorful stones, nor the glowing cube, nor the otherworldly crimson gem, nor the flaming demonic scroll. But he did know one thing. He hadn't eaten in a very long time... \nJeff's instincts took control. He opened his tiny jaws wide and started to swallow down almost everything in the gallery as quickly as he could. Alarms began to blare, but it didn't stop Jeff from consuming one object of power after another! \n\"There you are, Jeff!\" Mantis cried as she and her mysterious ally entered the now-empty gallery. \"We thought we had lost you. Are you... okay...?\"\n\"Mrrr...URP!\" Jeff belched in response. His tiny tummy had started to rumble after he had gulped down a little metal vial marked PYM. \nAs Jeff blushed with embarrassment, Mantis chuckled. Even the steel-willed stranger couldn't help but smirk. But all levity instantly faded as another group of guards arrived in the gallery. \n\"Tivan is going to have our heads!\" one guard shouted, as he realized that all of the artifacts in the private gallery had somehow vanished. \n\"Not if we bring him theirs first,\" another guard responded, aiming his weapon directly at Mantis and pulling the trigger. \n\"MRRRRR!\" \nWithout a second of hesitation, Jeff leapt between the guard and Mantis, instinctively shielding his friend from the oncoming blast. But as he intercepted the attack, something extraordinary happened. Jeff grew to ten times his regular size! \n\"Hmm,\" mused the warrior woman. \"Must've been something he ate...\" \nThe enlarged Jeff let out a delighted squeal as he charged toward the guards, all of whom dropped their weapons and retreated as swiftly as possible. \nAs soon as they were in the clear, Jeff beckoned Mantis and her friend to follow him. \n\"That's not the right way, friend,\" Mantis said. \"We found the hangar. It's in the other direction. That hall will just lead you back to your cell.\" \n\"Mrrr,\" Jeff said confidently, fully aware of what he was doing. \n\"Oh, I see,\" Mantis said with a smile. \"Good boy, Jeff.\" \nThe women raced after the giant Jeff, back into the heart of the menagerie. \n\"Stand back, everyone,\" Mantis cried out directly into the minds of all the captive creatures. \nAs the alien assemblage took cover within their cells, the massive land shark gave a mighty twirl, swinging his tail with tremendous force and shattering through the outer glass walls of countless enclosures. The lifeforms once trapped within suddenly emerged from holding and scattered in all directions, each seeking their own way out of the Collector's custody. \n\"Mrrr?\" Jeff asked as he began to shrink back down to his normal size. \n\"I know, Jeff,\" Mantis responded. \"But we don't have time to save them all. At least not yet.\" \n\"Come on,\" their curious companion said, leading Jeff and Mantis through the chaos and back toward the hangar. \"This may be our only chance.\" \nTogether, they entered the hangar, and Mantis located a spacecraft similar to the one she had flown during her time with the Guardians of the Galaxy. Relief washed over her as she led her new teammates onto the ship and powered it up. \n\"We're finally free,\" the other woman said with relief. \"We can go home now...\" \nBut the stoic warrior paused. She didn't need Mantis's empathic abilities to sense the sadness radiating through Jeff's mind as he looked back toward the creatures rampaging through the Theme Park below them. \n\"And they will be free, too,\" Mantis said reassuringly, placing a hand on Jeff's smooth fin and giving it a gentle rub. \"We will find help and come back for them. We will free every single one of them. And we will make sure the Collector pays for what he has done. How does that sound, little one?\" \nAs the ship lifted off, Jeff responded as only he could. With a toothy grin and an emphatic:\n \"MMMRRRRRR!!!\"",
