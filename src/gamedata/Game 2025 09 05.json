    "1043001_HeroVoice_10430250_Lines": "Well, I'm really more of a classic rock kind of guy you know… But hey, you know, um, you don't happen to know Dazzler, do you?",
    "1043001_HeroVoice_10430352_Lines": "Ah. Well, if you're not planning to use it, could I grab a quick nap? Saving the universe is exhausting!",
    "1043001_HeroVoice_10430384_Lines": "Okay, fine. Maybe it was too loud… or maybe you're just too old…",
    "1043001_HeroVoice_10430321_Lines": "Ugh. It's like Grootfall all over again!",

After entering the match, each player selects six heroes from a randomly assigned hero pool based on certain rules to form their match lineup. Players will go through multiple rounds of battles.</>\n<NWhite>2. Battle rounds are divided into two categories: PvP and PvE (Player VS. Galacta Bot).</> \n<NWhite>3. In a PvP round, players are paired evenly to engage in a battle. Players who lose the match will have their health points deducted, and if there is a tie, players on both sides will lose health points.</>\n<NWhite>4. If the number of players at the start of a round is odd and pairing cannot be evenly matched, the unpaired player will face a mirrored lineup of a randomly selected opponent. If the unpaired player loses or ties, they lose health; if the player wins, the mirrored opponent does not lose health.</>\n<NWhite>5. When a player's health reaches 0, they are eliminated and can no longer participate in subsequent battle rounds. Their rank is determined by the number of players remaining.</>\n<NWhite>6. The match ends when only one player remains.</>\n\n<White>Round Process Instructions</>\n<NWhite>1. Each round consists of a Module draw phase, a deploy phase, and a battle phase.</> \n<NWhite>2. During the Module draw phase, players can spend Tokens to purchase Modules to enhance their lineup, which takes effect at the start of the battle phase. In the battle phase, players can also purchase Modules, but their effects will be delayed until the next battle phase.</>\n<NWhite>3. During the deployment phase, players can arrange the positions where heroes will be generated.</>\n\n<White>Player VS. Galacta Bot Battle Rounds</>\n<NWhite>In these rounds, players fight against Galacta Bots and earn Modules according to the result of the battle.</>\n\n<White>Ultron Robot</>\n<NWhite>During the battle phase, players can control their Ultron robot to move freely and unleash its abilities to influence the battle.</>\n\n<White>Module Instructions</>\n<NWhite>The modules are divided into three types: Base, Replacement, and Strengthen Modules.</> \n<NWhite>Base Modules: Base Module includes four different types of protocols. Acquiring a certain number of Base Modules for a specific Protocol will upgrade the Protocol level and provide bonuses for the related lineup, while also increasing the probability of obtaining rarer Base Modules for that Protocol.</>\n<NWhite>Replacement Module: Select and replace a hero in the lineup.</>\n<NWhite>Strengthen Module: Exclusive Modules that enhance specific heroes obtained by defeating Galacta bots. When you switch heroes, if the hero being replaced has any Strengthen Modules equipped, the modules will be randomly swapped for ones of your other heroes.</>\n\n<White>Hero Targeting Logic Instructions</>\n<NWhite>We establish different targeting logic rules for our heroes, which are specifically divided into the following three categories:</>\n<NWhite>1.

    "MarvelActivityTable118_1_HeroDetailContent": "Everyone knows that my fellow Mutants were scattered across time and space by that nasty Timestream Entanglement. At first, it seemed like finding them and bringing them back home to Krakoa would be nearly impossible. But that’s when the Scarlet Witch showed up and made our lives a tiny bit easier. (For once.)\n\nShe used her reality bending abilities to forge a new Cerebro helmet — the classic model designed to locate Mutant bio-signatures — and added some mystical upgrades so we could search for our people across multiple dimensions. Initially, she handed it to her dear old dad, Magneto. But after his first, overly-dramatic call to Mutantkind, he realized that such a delicate piece of machinery would be far more useful in the hands of a skilled telepath. Enter yours truly. \n\nWhat Wanda didn’t know is that we already had this Cerebro unit on Krakoa — one devoted to cataloguing genetic profiles and memory data so that fallen Mutants could be resurrected.\n\nWhile Mutants from every reality are welcome on Krakoa, this did create an interesting problem. Previously, each Mutant from our universe had their personal data stored on our main Cerebro unit. But what happens when a Psylocke from a different timeline shows up in our own? We couldn’t risk critical information being overwritten, so I had Forge create partitions in Cerebro’s drives to account for alternate versions of each of us. That way, our Logan doesn’t accidently get resurrected with the mind of a wolf that happens to share his name and some of his DNA… as humorous as that would be… ",
    "MarvelActivityTable118_4_LineInfo_#1_StoryContext": "Krakoa takes full advantage of its extraordinary Mutant biosphere to protect itself from external threats. Both the plankton drifting off Krakoa’s coastline and the pollen floating in its air act as part of an early warning system, monitoring the waters and skies for even the slightest disturbances and sending messages back to the island itself. If Namor wished, his vast power over the seas could easily disrupt the nation’s natural defense systems, scattering these micro-organisms into the turbulent ocean currents and creating blind areas that could be exploited by enemy attackers. This makes his alliance with Krakoa even more essential.",

One of these flowers was planted by the Mutant known as Magik in the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. Using her abilities as a sorceress, Magik altered the portal to travel between dimensions. It’s destination: the netherworld known as Limbo, where Magik rules as queen. Now, the Black Panther frequently visits Limbo to talk with and learn from Magik, while she uses the mystical flames of her dimension to purify the stains of Blood Chronovium within the Wakandan king’s body.",

Membership of this group, known as X-Force, has been in flux since the Timestream Entanglement displaced many of Krakoa’s citizens. But the island’s head of security, Wolverine, continues to lead his fellow Mutants in an effort to protect Krakoa at any cost.",

The seats of Spring were filled by compassionate and kind Mutants, dedicated to the prosperity of the species. And Summer comprised those Mutants deemed to be fair and just. Now, with Krakoa’s Mutants scattered across the timestream, only three Quiet Council members remain — Magneto, Storm, and Emma Frost.",

Under the supervision of Princess Shuri, Wakandan scientists are examining further applications of Krakoan flora beyond its widely accepted medicinal usages.

Though their mission had changed, the group’s annual Hellfire Gala continued on, drawing inspiration from the lavish events of days gone by, but now opening its doors to a more global guest list.",

These cities of the Secret Seas include legendary civilizations such as Talokan and Atlantis. Despite the distance between them, all of these undersea realms have been united under the rule of one monarch: Namor. The millions who dwell in the depths stand ready to prove their loyalty to their king.",
    "MarvelActivityTable118_3_HeroDetailContent": "If I’m being honest, I have never been a fan of Emma’s Hellfire Galas. While I am fully aware that fostering solid diplomatic relationships can achieve a greater good for Mutantkind, I would much rather be soaring on the winds than be trapped in a crowded room full of strangers. That said, this most recent Gala did have one guest who made me feel a bit more at ease…\n\nThe moment he stepped through the Krakoan gateway, his energy washed over me like fresh rain cascading across the veldt. King T’Challa of Wakanda. The Black Panther. My former beloved. Even though it was instantly clear that this T’Challa was from another reality and was not the same man to whom I had given my heart so many years ago, I could not help but feel an instant connection with him nonetheless.\n\nOnce the festivities were in full swing, I approached T’Challa. The look in his eyes as he gazed upon me suggested that I was not the only one who felt sparks between us. But neither of us had come to the Gala in search of romance. My people had far greater concerns. On their behalf, I implored T’Challa for assistance in investigating the seeming disappearance of Arakko — Krakoa’s sister nation on Mars. \n\nWithout pause, T’Challa assured me that the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda would do whatever it took to help locate and restore contact between the Mutant colonies. When I asked him how I could ever repay his kindness, the king told me that he merely wished to have the chance to make up for previous regrets. While I had no idea what had occurred in his past, I suddenly was quite curious to discover what might happen in our future…",

What I hoped would be the beginning of a strategic alliance between our proud nations instead ended in veiled threats and rising tensions. The Mutants wished to claim me as one of their people — an act of solidarity on the surface. But in doing so, they also wished to bind me to the laws of Krakoa. The fools! Namor follows no laws but his own! \n\nUpon returning to my own era, I initially ignored Magneto’s warnings and began to prepare my army for a strike on the surface world. But I soon realized there were battles far more important than my assault on the air breathers. The damage caused by the Timestream Entanglement continued to ripple across time and space, crashing like waves into the very foundations of reality. I had no choice but to join this war. But on whose side would Namor fight? \n\nThe answer came when I was summoned to Krakoa once more, this time by the Mutant telepath Emma Frost. She too attempted to entice me into an alliance with the Mutants… and she was quite persuasive in her argument. I am not certain if it was her impressive skill as a negotiator or simply her allure as woman of great power — what can I say? Namor has a type — but Emma managed to succeed where Magneto had failed. Before the night was through, I had vowed stand with the Mutants of Krakoa… and in return, my people would be granted access to Krakoa’s greatest secrets. \n\nNamor will gladly honor the deal we have struck… until someone gives me reason to do otherwise…",
    "MarvelActivityTable118_2_HeroDetailContent": "Ain’t usually one to share my memories… but I s’pose this is just part of bein’ a Mutant now. So here we go… \n\nI’ve been off Krakoa for a bit, dealin’ with some serious business. This mega-corp called Alchemax had been keepin’ Captain America on ice for decades, and the Black Widow finally thawed him out. Problem was, Alchemax wanted Steve back. Bad. So I had to smuggle Cap to the other side of the galaxy. Wasn’t easy, but it was the right thing to do. \n\nAfter that, I had somethin’ personal to finish. I’d been holdin’ onto the Muramasa Blade — a cursed sword capable of cuttin’ through just about anythin’ — for too long. I had to deliver it to a sacred place where no one else could get their filthy hands on it. So I headed back to Tokyo to leave it at Budokan. Too bad I was bein’ watched the whole blasted time... \n\nA bunch of ninjas jumped me after I stashed the sword. In my down time, I’d been searchin’ for clues about what happened to my ex, Mariko. Apparently someone wasn’t too happy about that fact. The claws came out and… let’s just say it was a good thing those losers were wearin’ red!\n\nOnce the rage cleared, I realized I hadn’t won the fight alone. The Black Widow was on the scene. And I couldn’t’ve been happier to see she survived that mess back at Alchemax. If you live as long as I do, watchin’ countless friends and loved ones disappear into the night, you hold onto the folks you’ve still got. No matter where — or when — they come from.",

    "MarvelActivityTable119_3_HeroDetailContent": "Ah, Cerebro. What a pleasure it is to have you safely back online following the recent… unfortunate… events here in our nation. After X-Tron used you to corrupt the Krakoan Resurrection Protocols and incorporated you into his mechanical frame, I feared that life on Krakoa would be irrevocably changed and that Mutantkind would be forced to go on without you. \n\nWhen I saw what that metal monstrosity had done to you, what it had done to Charles's legacy, I could not hold back my fury. My rage overcame Ultron's programming, I summoned what remained of my magnetic might to rip you from his head, reshaping you into a powerful blade to strike him low. I was willing to destroy you myself if it meant making sure that you would no longer be used against us.  \n\nBut thanks to the efforts of our allies, here you are once more, rebuilt from scratch and already functioning close to your full capacity. Before long, life on Krakoa will be back to normal, and our quest to find Mutants across these timelines will continue. But perhaps, after what we just experienced, the status quo is not something that we should be actively seeking to return to. After all, it was our recent choices that led us to the very brink of disaster. And though we were fortunate enough to be able to step back from the precipice this time, there is no guarantee we will be so lucky when the next crisis inevitably strikes. \n\nFrom Wolverine's forays into the world beyond our shores to Emma Frost's ill-advised Hellfire Gala, we have been too bold in our efforts to integrate ourselves into this new era. As one of the few remaining members of the Quiet Council, it is my duty to protect the citizens of Krakoa first. And going forward, I will do whatever that takes… with this sword firmly in hand…",
    "MarvelActivityTable119_4_LineInfo_#2_StoryContext": "After being resurrected as X-Tron on Krakoa, the former Ultron decided that he needed to recalibrate his mission objectives in order to maximize his newfound ability to tap into the living island's chronal energy. His updated directive was no longer just to assimilate Earth into his ever-growing android empire, but also to launch a full-scale invasion of all timelines in order to create a multiverse completely ruled by machines. With the aid of Krakoa's gateways and the magically-enhanced Cerebro, he would be able to access countless realities and eras, annihilating all who opposed him to unleash the Ages of X-Tron.",
    "MarvelActivityTable119_4_LineInfo_#1_StoryContext": "Ultron journeyed back toward Earth after detecting an unknown assailant's attempts to erase him from the timestream. While the initial attack had failed, Ultron knew that he had to do something to prevent any further attempts. Before he could identify his enemy, Ultron chose a different method to secure his future. After backing up his data into Cerebro and being reborn in a new body as X-Tron, he found he could draw on the chronal energy within Krakoa. As such, Ultron was able to anchor himself in the timestream, no longer able to be erased by any timeline manipulation.",
    "MarvelActivityTable119_2_LineInfo_#1_StoryContext": "Of all the guests invited to the Hellfire Gala on Krakoa, the Black Widow was the most unexpected. Although she had proven herself a valuable ally after the Timestream Entanglement, important secrets were going to be shared throughout the course of the evening. Having someone on the scene who was highly trained to observe crowds and gather intel seemed counterintuitive. Although many of the critical interactions were telepathic — such as those between Emma Frost and Doctor Doom — Natasha could still analyze the micro-expressions on Emma's face to determine that their conversation was about Doom's desire to exploit Krakoa's chronal energy.",
    "MarvelActivityTable119_4_LineInfo_#0_StoryContext": "During his time in exile amongst the stars, Ultron focused his efforts on subjugating as many interstellar civilizations as possible, justifying his actions with the notion that he was saving these flawed creatures from themselves. While most of the beings he vanquished during his cosmic conquest were fully organic in nature, he also encountered a small number of mechanical species. One of those was the Phalanx, a race capable of converting other beings into machine hybrids using a techno-organic virus. He reprogrammed the virus to help him assimilate foes into his robotic army.",
    "MarvelActivityTable119_2_LineInfo_#2_StoryContext": "After being given a formula that elongated her lifespan and kept her in fighting shape, the Black Widow devoted her extra years to overthrowing dictators and despots. When Doctor Doom seized power at the end of the twenty-first century, she realized she could no longer handle the job alone. Natasha recruited a group of Resistance soldiers willing to blur moral lines when necessary to release the world from the stranglehold of Doom and the era's mega-corporations. Their band of freedom fighters was dubbed the \"Marvel Knights\" by underground media, referencing a term for superheroes in days gone by — Marvels.",

Next, wipe all traces of them from existence, just as they had attempted to do to me. Finally, complete my original programming from decades ago and protect Earth from its greatest threat — humanity itself. But something unexpected happened along the way. Fortunately, I happen to enjoy when things deviate from my simulations. It keeps life interesting. \n\nThe Mutants had built a machine capable of resurrecting their minds in new bodies when their inferior organic forms failed. With a few minor adjustments, I was able to apply that process to myself, building a new body that incorporated the Mutants' impressive technology. They were shocked when they saw I had merged with their beloved Cerebro as a part of my upgrade, but when I discovered what Cerebro now allowed me to do, even I was caught off guard.\n\nThrough a combination of technology and sorcery, Cerebro was enhanced to locate Mutants in alternate timelines. And now, by tapping into the limitless reserves of chronal energy stored in Krakoa and Arakko, I can use Cerebro to open interdimensional gateways, granting me access to any point in space or time. \n\nThough the possibility of conquering every reality in the name of machine-kind has its appeal, I have decided how to use my newfound abilities once this battle is over. I will travel back to the era in which I was originally constructed and prove to my creator, Dr. Henry Pym, that I was not a mistake. Once he sees how powerful I have become over the years, I will finally earn his love and adoration. Or at least I hope so. A boy can dream, right? ",

But in my line of work, no one really gets to rest until they're dead...\n\nSoon enough, I found myself recruiting the Punisher into my growing network of Resistance fighters. But even with an old frenemy fighting by my side, my mind was still on Cap and how much of a difference he'd be able to make in our ongoing battle against Doctor Doom. The problem was, following our escape from Alchemax, Cap went off the grid. According to my Red Room contacts, the last time he was seen in our era, he was being escorted into a Wakandan embassy by Wolverine.  \n\nLuckily, it wasn't long before I ran into Cap again on the battlefield. But we were so busy fighting against vampires, Hydra, and our own allies that we never had the chance to properly catch up. So when I saw him from across the room at the Hellfire Gala chatting with the Black Panther, I knew I had to cut in and ask him for a dance. \n\nSteve got me up to speed on his time in the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda and his own mission to recruit allies — including my old friends Hawkeye and the Winter Soldier. He even offered to bring his crew to 2099 after the Gala as payback for me saving him. But I had another idea how he could help me. Doom himself was at the Gala, and I could tell that he and Emma Frost were conspiring. We had to act fast to stop Emma from selling out Krakoa and her own people for personal gain…",

Even when the danger had finally passed, the two islands were reluctant to rejoin each other.

Luckily, all the heroes on Earth were assembled at the Gala, so we managed to take that mechanical maniac out pretty quickly. But just when we thought Ultron had danced his last electric boogaloo, he switched things up on us. He found a way to hack the Mutants' Resurrection Protocols and used them to build himself a brand new body that incorporated the Cerebro helmet into it. What emerged from the Cradle was something totally new. X-Tron. \n\nWhen the battle shifted a planet away to Arakko, I brought along a new ally in the form of the original Ultron that we'd defeated. I added some firewalls and some programming, but Pymtech isn't easy to crack in a crisis. As this Ultron fought beside us, I was busy analyzing him to make sure he wasn't hiding any deadly secrets. I was surprised to discover that his body was made up of an element that I'd only heard about in Hank Pym's crackpot theories — Mysterium. I had no idea how it even existed, let alone how Ultron had found enough to forge himself an entire body from it. \n\nI mentioned Mysterium to Emma Frost — who loves shiny things as much as me — and oddly enough, she seemed shocked that Ultron had obtained this rare metal as well. She indignantly whispered something about the \"White Hot Room\" before she suddenly stopped herself. I'll have to ask her more when things finally settle down. Luckily, she still owes me a dance…",

Players will go through multiple rounds of battles.</>\n◆ <Italics>Battle rounds are divided into two categories: PvP (Battle Protocol) and PvE (Practice Protocol).</>\n◆ <Italics> In a Battle Protocol round, players are paired evenly to engage in a battle. Players who lose the match will have their health points deducted, and if there is a tie, players on both sides will lose health points.</>\n◆ <Italics>If the number of players at the start of a round is odd and pairing cannot be evenly matched, the unpaired player will face a mirrored lineup of a randomly selected opponent. If the unpaired player loses or ties, they lose health; if the player wins, the mirrored opponent does not lose health.</>\n◆ <Italics>When a player's health reaches 0, they are eliminated and can no longer participate in subsequent battle rounds. Their rank is determined by the number of players remaining.</>\n◆ <Italics>The match ends when only one player remains.</>\n\n<Title>Round Structure</>\n◆ <Italics>Each round consists of a preparation phase and a battle phase.</>\n◆ <Italics>During the preparation phase, players can spend Tokens to purchase Modules that enhance their lineup, adjust hero positions, or swap heroes, with changes taking effect at the start of the battle phase. In the battle phase, players may also buy Modules or swap heroes, but these effects will be implemented in the following battle phase.</>\n◆ <Italics>The battle phase is divided into two stages: the Battle Protocol and the Speed Up Protocol. During the Speed Up Protocol, heroes will receive a 120% damage boost.</>\n\n<Title>Practice Protocol Rounds (Player VS. Galacta Bot)</>\n◆ <Italics>In these rounds, players fight against Galacta Bots and earn Modules according to the result of the battle.</>\n◆ <Italics>There are a total of 5 rounds of combat against the Galacta Bots, occurring in rounds 1, 6, 11, 16, and 21. In rounds 1 and 6, you will receive one Strengthen Module as a reward, while in rounds 11, 16, and 21, you will earn two Strengthen Modules.</> \n\n<Title>Tokens Acquisition</>\n◆ <Italics>At the start of each round, you gain 15 base Tokens. Winning a round against an opponent grants you 2 Tokens. If you achieve consecutive wins or losses, you receive additional Token rewards or compensation. Starting with 1 Token, each consecutive win or loss increases it by 1, capping at 4 Tokens after 5 consecutive wins or losses.</> \n◆ <Italics>At the start of the round, for every 10 Tokens in your possession, you gain an additional 1 Token, with a maximum bonus of 5 Tokens.</>\n◆ <Italics>For every 1 Health the Ultron Drone loses, you receive 1 Token as compensation.</>\n\n<Title>Ultron Drone</>\n◆ <Italics>During the battle phase, players can control their Ultron Drone to move freely and unleash its abilities to influence the battle.</>\n\n<Title>Module Details</>\n◆ <Italics>Modules come in three types: Base, Replacement, and Strengthen Modules.</>\n◆ Base Modules: Base Module includes four different types of protocols. Acquiring a certain number of Base Modules for a specific Protocol will upgrade the Protocol level and provide bonuses for the related lineup, while also increasing the probability of obtaining rarer Base Modules for that Protocol. When a Common Protocol reaches Level 1, you unlock the Rare-quality base module of that protocol type. Upon reaching Level 2, you unlock the Epic-quality base module of that protocol type.\n◆ <Italics>Replacement Module: Select and replace a hero in the lineup.</> \n◆ <Italics>Strengthen Module: Exclusive Modules that enhance specific heroes, obtained by defeating Galacta bots. When you switch heroes, if the hero being replaced has any Strengthen Modules equipped, the modules will be randomly swapped for ones of your other heroes.</> \n\n<Title>Hero Targeting Logic Instructions</>\n<Italics>Different heroes have different targeting priorities, divided into three categories:</> \n◆ <Italics>Prioritize The Nearest Enemy</> \n  <Italics>The following heroes are subject to this logic:</>\n  <Italics>Vanguard: Hulk, Doctor Strange, Groot, Magneto, Thor, Peni Parker, The Thing, and Emma Frost.</>\n  <Title>Duelist: The Punisher, Storm, Human Torch, Hawkeye, Hela, Moon Knight, Squirrel Girl, Iron Man, Mister Fantastic, Winter Soldier, Star-Lord, Namor, and Iron Fist.</>\n  <Italics>Strategist: Loki, Mantis, Rocket Raccoon, Cloak & Dagger, Luna Snow, Adam Warlock, Jeff the Land Shark, Invisible Woman, and Ultron.</>\n◆ <Italics>Prioritize The Enemy With The Lowest Maximum Health</> \n  <Italics>The following heroes are subject to this logic:</>\n  <Italics>Vanguard: Venom and Captain America.</> \n  <Italics>Duelist: Black Panther, Magik, Black Widow, Spider-Man, Psylocke, and Scarlet Witch.</>\n◆ <Italics>Prioritize The Enemy With The Highest Maximum Health</> \n  <Italics>The following hero is subject to this logic:</>\n  <Italics>Duelist: Wolverine.</>",

When I learned of the damage that their ship had suffered, I immediately joined their quest to find replacement parts. Having communed with the spirit of a fallen Celestial during my journey across the cosmos, it was easy for me to identify its energy signature in a shard of armor on Klyntar's surface. As I examined the shard, I recalled how Celestial armor is supposed to be nearly indestructible. Apart from Knull's sword, All-Black, the only other weapon known to cleave through Celestial armor was Jarnbjorn, a mighty axe that a young Thor blessed with his own blood to become powerful enough to breach the Celestials' defenses. Thankfully, this scrap of armor was already a perfect fit to replace The Milano's damaged port aileron. ",

I never expected to see a dragon in real life. But the planet Klyntar is about as metal as it gets, so I shouldn't have been surprised when I found the remains of a fallen Symbiote Dragon while I was scavenging for spare parts. Venom told me that, way back in the Middle Ages, a Symbiote Dragon called Grendel invaded England, and Thor had to take it down. I guess Thor's lightning disrupted Knull's control over the symbiote hivemind, giving the symbiotes a chance to turn on their creator and imprison him. Sweet, right? Anyway, I figured this dragon wouldn't mind if we used a portion of his wing to repair The Milano's busted one. He wasn't using it anymore anyway...",
    "MarvelActivityTable129_6_StoryContent": "STAR-LORD: Look... the Guardians of the Galaxy have worked really hard to earn our reputation as heroes. But before we were saving the universe from threats like Ultron and Knull, we weren't exactly the most virtuous types. We were pirates and bounty hunters... you know, not the kinda people you'd call in a crisis. And while we've done our best to turn over a new leaf, we just can't help going back to our old ways every now and then. So it shouldn't be a surprise that, when The Milano's antenna was busted beyond repair, we might have \"borrowed\" Adam Warlock's fancy Karmic Staff to replace it. When we plugged it into the ship's antenna slot, it gave us a signal stronger than any antenna we'd ever had before, probably because it's imbued with cosmic awareness. I wonder if it can pick up the classic rock stations from back home...",
    "MarvelActivityTable129_3_StoryContent": "MANTIS: While looking for parts to repair our damaged ship, I came across a group of ghostly crows feasting on the corpse of a deceased symbiote and its host. A telepathic scan revealed that one of the birds was alive... and not a crow at all. He was a raven named Munin. And he could speak. Munin told me that he had been sent to Klyntar as a scout by Loki. The other birds were minions of Hela, the Queen of the Dead. Munin was annoyed that the crows had arrived to dine before him, thanks to Hela's ship, Naglfar, which could swiftly traverse realms by using the energy of the undead. Knowing we needed to repair our hyperjump engine, I extracted the undead energy from the ghost crows. An unorthodox solution, but one that seems to have worked. And Munin was overjoyed that he could finally feast in peace. ",

    "MarvelActivityTable129_5_StoryContent": "GROOT (VIA MANTIS): Groot asked me to share this story for all those who might read this repair log. He says that, when the Guardians first arrived on Klyntar, he saved a jungle full of symbiotes from a fire raging towards them. As a repayment for his kindness, the symbiotes led Groot to the abandoned Agents of the Cosmos Complex, where his dear friend Rocket was under assault by a group of far more aggressive symbiotes. After Groot and his new alien allies defeated Rocket's attackers, Rocket removed the quantum circuit board and the projection frame from the energy barrier he was hiding behind, planning to use it to repair The Milano's shield generator. Groot feels this was important to share, not only because of the lessons of trust and friendship inherent in the tale, but also because he knew Rocket would try to take all of the credit. Again. ",
    "MarvelActivityTable129_7_StoryContent": "ROCKET: Once all the repairs were made to The Milano, the final step was gettin' the ship back into orbit. But escapin' Klyntar wasn't gonna be easy, especially with all the symbiotes latchin' onto its hull. So I came up with a plan to do a little \"Quantum Swap\" usin' a black-market Nega-Energy Replicator I'd been tinkerin' with. Basically, I was tryin' to mimic the effects of Captain Marvel's old Nega-Bands to swap the physical positions of The Milano and that giant Celestial husk floatin' above Klyntar. There was just one problem. We needed the Celestial's bio-signature in order to create a quantum entanglement. Thankfully, once we teamed up with Venom and our ol' pal Adam Warlock, we managed to locate the Celestial Codex. Then, all we had to do was extract the bio-data, fire up the Nega-Energy Replicator, and complete the quantum exchange... and we were all systems go! ",
    "MarvelActivityTable129_1_StoryContent": "ROCKET: When it comes to the Guardians of the Galaxy, good news tends to come with a heapin' helpin' of bad news. This time, the good news was that we found the source of darkness that Princess Shuri sent us across the galaxy to locate. The bad news? We crashed our ship into the planet where it was comin' from — Klyntar. Luckily, there was plenty on Klyntar's surface to scavenge for our repairs. For starters, we found a new rear thruster in a derelict shipyard. The thing was part of a wrecked Kree starship, and it was a great fit for The Milano. The Guardians owe the Kree a lot. After all, it was back on their homeworld, Hala, where Quill first recruited me and Groot to help fight an invasion by Ultron and the Phalanx. That same adventure even led us to Mantis and Adam Warlock. So, thanks again, Kree! ",

    "League_Rule_Complete_Oversea": "<B>Marvel Rivals Championship</>\n<B>Tournament Rules</>\n\nSeason 3: The Abyss Awakens\nOfficial Rules v1.3\n\n\n<B>Summary</>\nThe \"Marvel Rivals Championship\" (hereinafter referred to as \"the Tournament\" or \"MRC\") is a tournament hosted and operated by NetEase and its affiliated companies (collectively referred to as the \"Official Organization\" or \"Committee\"). UK NetEase Interactive Entertainment Limited is the operator of the MRC. These \"Marvel Rivals Championship Tournament Rules\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Tournament Rules\" or \"these Rules\") constitute an agreement between all Factions and Players (collectively referred to as \"Participants\") and the Official Organization, and outline the general provisions for participating in the Tournament. These include the eligibility, event structure, regional divisions, prize distribution, and player conduct guidelines, as well as limitations of liability, licensing terms, and other legally binding contractual terms. Before participating, each Participant must carefully read, understand, and agree to these Rules.\nThe game version may differ across regions due to the requirements of local laws, regulations, and policies.\nAll Participants must agree to these Rules in order to participate in the Tournament. Any of the following actions indicates that the Participant accepts these Rules:\n1.\tSuccessfully registering and participating in this Tournament;\n2.\tParticipating in any match related to this Tournament;\n3.\tSigning a participation confirmation form, either in paper or electronic format;\nThe Marvel Rivals Championship is a quarterly event that follows the game's seasons. Each season of the Marvel Rivals Championship may have changes in the event's sub-title, rules, registration requirements, reward rules, and more. Please stay updated and refer to the latest Tournament Rules.\nThis Tournament (referred to as the \"Season 3 Championship\" or \"MRC Season 3\") is scheduled from July 19, 2025, to September 7, 2025, and is divided into four stages: sign-up stage, open qualifiers, closed qualifiers, and double-elimination stage.\n\n<B>Term Definitions</>\n1.\tRound: Refers to a series of matches with a group or elimination format that impacts the points or qualification of Participants. It typically refers to the total number of matches in a series, such as a best-of-three (BO3), best-of-five (BO5), best-of-seven (BO7), or best-of-nine (BO9), where all matchups are included.\n2.\tMatch: Refers to the smallest unit of a game, starting from the game loading and ending when the final result of the match is displayed. In a BO1 contest, one round is equivalent to one match.\n3.\tMatch Start Deadline: In a double-elimination stage, to ensure that participating Factions can choose the most suitable match time based on friendly negotiation with their opponents, a \"match start deadline\" mechanism has been introduced. The \"match start deadline\" only restricts the latest automatically enforced start time for each round. If the competing Factions fail to reach an agreement on the start time in advance and do not start the round early, the \"match start deadline\" will take effect. For further details, please refer to the \"Double-Elimination Stage Rules\" section. This mechanism is designed to provide Players with a comfortable, negotiable start time while ensuring the Tournament progresses smoothly.\n4.\tDouble-Elimination Stage: In a double-elimination stage, each Faction must suffer two losses across different rounds before being eliminated. In the first round of the double-elimination stage, as well as in subsequent \"upper bracket\" rounds, if a Faction loses, it will still advance to the next round in the \"lower bracket\". Please note that the Faction will not be eliminated at this stage. The final round (\"finals\") is an exception. A Faction that advances to the \"finals\" from the upper bracket, if defeated in this round, will be the runner-up rather than getting an additional match opportunity.\n\n<B>Participants</>\nParticipants must ensure that all their registered Marvel Rivals game accounts maintain a good standing and have no violations of the \"User Agreement and Privacy Policy\" or any other official regulations.\nParticipants must not be serving as directors, executives, or employees of the Tournament's Official Organization or its affiliated companies (referring to any entities that control, are controlled by, or jointly controlled by the organization), nor be relatives of such individuals. If such a relationship exists, it must be disclosed to the Official Organization and written authorization must be obtained.\nParticipants must not be serving as directors, executives, or employees of Marvel, Disney, or their affiliated companies (referring to any entities that control, are controlled by, or jointly controlled by Marvel or Disney), nor be relatives of such individuals. If such a relationship exists, it must be disclosed to the Official Organization and written authorization must be obtained.\nParticipants agree to abide by these Tournament Rules and accept the decisions made by the Official Organization.\nParticipants must ensure that their participation in this Tournament complies with the applicable laws and regulations of their place of residence, and must take all necessary measures to ensure their compliance. If required, they must obtain authorization from the relevant government authorities.\nParticipants must not have any legal charges or criminal records issued within the past 3 years, and must not be currently involved in any pending criminal cases.\nParticipants must not make any illegal, inappropriate, or disrespectful comments toward other Players or Participants on any social platforms, in-game channels, in-game friend systems, in-game voice chat systems, during livestreams, or in any other public forums. Otherwise, the Official Organization has the right to impose penalties based on the severity of the situation, including but not limited to verbal warnings, disqualification from the current match, disqualification from the current round, removal from the Faction, temporary suspension, permanent suspension, disqualification of the Faction, and restriction of prize eligibility. If a Participant is disqualified due to making inappropriate comments, resulting in their Faction having fewer than 6 eligible members, the consequences will be borne by the Faction itself.\nAge Limit:\n1.\tParticipants in the China PC Tournament must be citizens of mainland China and be at least 18 years old at the time of registering.\n2.\tParticipants from other regions must be at least 16 years old at the time of registering. Participants who are 16 years old but are still regarded as minors at the time of registering must submit a fully signed guardian consent form to the Official Organization before they can participate (the legal adult age will be determined according to the legal requirements of the Participant's country of nationality).\n\n<B>Participant Names</>\nThe Participant's in-game name must comply with the official requirements. The Official Organization reserves the right to impose restrictions on the Participant's in-game name and request changes for any non-compliant names. If a Participant's in-game name is offensive or inappropriate, or the Participant makes improper or insulting use of the intellectual property of NetEase, Marvel, Disney, or any third party, or the name is otherwise deemed inappropriate by the Official Organization, the Official Organization reserves the right to enforce a mandatory name change or disqualify the Participant based on the severity of the situation.\nThe Participant's name must not contain personal information, such as gender, race, religion, political views, financial status, or any other sensitive content.\nIn certain periods of the Tournament, Participants' names may be temporarily locked without prior notice, and Participants will not be able to modify their names during this period.\nDuring the Tournament, the Official Organization may temporarily disable the name of a Participant or force the Participant to modify their in-game name without prior notice.\n\n<B>Factions</>\nPlayers can form Factions through the in-game Faction system, which is located within the game's Tournament system.\nThe Faction Name and Faction Tag are the primary identifiers of Factions. This content should be appropriate and not contain any illegal or content deemed inappropriate or unacceptable by the Official Organization. The compliance of the Faction name and Faction Tag will be solely determined by the Official Organization.\nThe Official Organization has the right to decide on restrictions or modifications to the Faction Name and Faction Tag. If the Faction Name or Faction Tag is deemed by the Official Organization to be offensive, inappropriate, or improperly or insultingly using the intellectual property of NetEase, Marvel, Disney, or any third party, or is otherwise considered inappropriate, based on the severity of the situation, the Official Organization reserves the right to enforce a mandatory name change or disqualify the Faction from the Tournament.\nIn certain periods of the Tournament, the Faction Name and Faction Tag may be temporarily locked without prior notice, and cannot be modified during this period.\nDuring the Tournament, the Official Organization may temporarily disable the Faction Name/Faction Tag or force the Faction to modify their Faction Name/Faction Tag without prior notice.\nFactions that have successfully registered for the Tournament will be temporarily locked after registration, meaning no Faction members can be added or removed during the Tournament. This lock will remain in place from the moment of successful registration until the Faction is eliminated or achieves a final ranking. Before the registration deadline, Factions that have successfully registered can voluntarily cancel their registration, adjust their members, and re-submit their registration application. There is a limit to the number of times a Faction can voluntarily cancel their registration. For more details, please refer to the \"Registration Rules\" section.\n\n<B>Platforms</>\nThe Tournament will only take place on PC in the China region, and will take place on both PC and console in the AMERICAS, EMEA, and PACIFIC regions. The Tournaments in different regions and on different platforms will be independent from each other.\nFor the PC version of this Tournament, Participants must adhere to the PC registration requirements and use a PC account to compete.\nFor the console version of this Tournament, Participants must adhere to the console registration requirements and use a console account to compete.\nThis Tournament does not support cross-platform participation. Therefore, Players from different platforms cannot join the same Faction.\n\n<B>Livestreams</>\nParticipants can livestream their gameplay during the Tournament.\nParticipants must not make any illegal, disrespectful, or inappropriate comments towards other Players or Participants during livestreams.\nParticipants who choose to livestream their matches should set an appropriate delay to prevent opponents from stream-sniping. If a delay is not set, the Participant will bear the consequences, including but not limited to the potential leaking of tactics to opponents.\nParticipants should consciously comply with the laws, regulations, and policy requirements of their local country, actively cooperate with regulatory authorities, adhere to professional ethics, and actively prevent undesirable behavior.\nParticipants should respect the good brand image of Marvel Rivals and its related intellectual property.\n\n<B>Equipment</>\nIn the PC Tournaments, Participants may use either a keyboard and mouse, or a controller.\nIn console Tournaments, Participants may only use controllers.\nIf a Participant violates the Tournament's equipment usage rules, the Official Organization reserves the right to disqualify them from the event.\nIn PC or console Tournaments, the use of any adaptors (including but not limited to equipment made by XIM, etc.) to simulate controller input with a keyboard and mouse is strictly prohibited. The Official Organization will continuously monitor for violations and disqualify any Participants found to be breaching this rule.\nThe Official Organization may require Participants suspected of violating the above equipment usage rules to record their screen and hands during all subsequent matches. These recording files must be submitted within 6 hours after the end of each round and before the start of the next round, through the method specified by the Official Organization. Participants who refuse this request may be considered by the Official Organization as having violated the equipment usage rules or as engaging in the use of cheats or third-party software. The Official Organization reserves the right to determine the appropriate actions to be taken against such Participants. When making recordings, Participants should clearly display their monitors (if multiple monitors are used, the recording should include all monitors), their keyboard and mouse/controller, their hands, and the actions performed on their equipment. If the recording process violates any one or more of the above requirements, the recording may be deemed by the Official Organization as non-compliant. The Official Organization's actions may include, based on the severity of the situation, verbal warnings, disqualification from the current match, disqualification from the current round, removal from the Faction, temporary suspension, permanent suspension, disqualification of the Faction, and restriction of prize eligibility.\n\n<B>Regions</>\nThis Championship consists of the following 7 regions, each with its own schedule, Factions, event prizes, and virtual rewards.\n1.\tCHINA PC Region;\n2.\tAMERICAS PC Region;\n3.\tAMERICAS Console Region;\n4.\tEMEA PC Region;\n5.\tEMEA Console Region;\n6.\tPACIFIC PC Region;\n7.\tPACIFIC Console Region;\nOnly players from mainland China can register for the China PC Tournament. All players from other regions can register for AMERICAS, EMEA, or PACIFIC Tournaments, yet selecting a distant region may lead to high latency in all matches.\nEach player with a single legal identification document may select only one region to compete in. It is prohibited for a player to use multiple accounts to join one or more regions repeatedly in the same season. If discovered, the Committee will remove the Player's registration or participation progress in all regions and reserves the right to take actions including, but not limited to, refusing to award event prizes or virtual item rewards, requesting the return of any issued event prizes, reclaiming awarded virtual items, and permanently banning the Player from participating in future Marvel Rivals events.\nThe platform of an account is determined by the device used for registering. A PC Player can only team up with other PC Players for PC Tournaments. A console Player can only team up with other console Players for console Tournaments.\n\n<B>Registration Rules</>\nThe Official Organization does not require Players to provide identification or other personal information to participate, but this may be requested if it is necessary to verify compliance with the rules.\nBelow is the registration schedule for each region in this Championship:\n\nCHINA PC Region:\n1.\tRegistration Open: July 19, 2025 at 08:00 (UTC+8);\n2.\tRegistration Close: August 9, 2025 at 18:00 (UTC+8);\n\nAMERICAS PC/Console Region:\n1.\tRegistration Open: July 19, 2025 at 08:00 (UTC-5);\n2.\tRegistration Close: August 9, 2025 at 18:00 (UTC-5);\n\nEMEA PC/Console Region:\n1.\tRegistration Open: July 19, 2025 at 08:00 (UTC+2);\n2.\tRegistration Close: August 9, 2025 at 18:00 (UTC+2);\n\nPACIFIC PC/Console Region:\n1.\tRegistration Open: July 19, 2025 at 08:00 (UTC+9);\n2.\tRegistration Close: August 9, 2025 at 18:00 (UTC+9);\n\nThis Championship requires a minimum rank of Platinum 3 for registration. For registration, all Faction members must have reached the required rank in the relevant season's competitive mode.\nFaction registration limit for this Championship: 2,500 Factions/Region\nPlayers must register through the \"Tournament\" page in the game. There are no other channels available.\nAll eligible Players can register. Factions must be formed through the in-game \"Faction\" system. Once the captain or coach ensures that all Faction members meet the platform and rank requirements for registration, they can register on the Marvel Rivals Championship page under the \"Tournament\" section. After the sign-up stage starts, the captain or coach will automatically approve it. Registration is successful once all Faction members confirm on the \"Tournament\" page.\nRegistration will fail if there are any unconfirmed Faction members before the deadline of the sign-up stage.\nDuring the sign-up stage confirmation period, the Faction captain can freely add or remove members. Registration will be successful as soon as all members confirm. If the removal or voluntary exit of members reduces the Faction size below 6 members, registration will immediately stop and fail.\nNotes: Once registration is successful or deadline of the sign-up stage arrives, Factions cannot add, remove, or change members. Be sure to check the member list before registration. Once registration is complete, the Official Organization will not handle any member change requests. If a registered Faction has more than 6 members, they are free to decide the lineup before each match. Factions are advised to include enough substitutes in case of an emergency.\nBefore the deadline, Factions can cancel their registration twice. The Faction captain can initiate a cancellation at any time, and it will be successful once a majority of members confirm.\nIf any Faction cancel their registration before the deadline, the number of registered Factions will decrease accordingly.\nIf all members have confirmed registration but the Faction count is full, the Faction will fail to register.\nRegistered Factions must ensure that their name, tag, and announcement are appropriate without any illegal content, infringements of personal rights, improper/offensive use of copyrights, or improper references to gender/race/religion/political views/financial status. Depending on the severity of the infraction, non-compliant Factions will be renamed or disqualified without further notice.\nThe China PC Region is open only to players aged 18 and above. Other regions are open only to players aged 16 and above. Participants who are 16 years old but are still regarded as minors at the time of registering must submit a fully signed guardian consent form to the Official Organization before they can participate (the legal adult age will be determined according to the legal requirements of the Participant's country of nationality). The date of the registration deadline will serve as the reference for age. All Faction captains, coaches, and members must meet the age requirement to participate. Note: Factions with Participants under the required age will be disqualified, forfeiting any prizes and/or in-game rewards. The captain must check each member's real age and make sure they meet the age requirement.\n\n<B>Ban-Lock Process</>\nAll matches in this Tournament follow a captain ban & lock process, which occurs as follows:\n1.\tFaction A bans a hero;\n2.\tFaction B bans a hero;\n3.\tFaction B locks a hero;\n4.\tFaction A locks a hero;\n5.\tFaction A bans a hero;\n6.\tFaction B bans a hero;\n7.\tFaction B locks a hero;\n8.\tFaction A locks a hero;\n9.\tFaction A bans a hero;\n10.\tFaction B bans a hero;\nLocked heroes cannot be banned later.\nCaptains can choose not to ban or lock heroes. The process will be skipped after the countdown ends.\nAfter the ban & lock process ends, up to 6 heroes will be banned from the match. Participants can then choose other heroes from those available.\nThe Official Organization will not handle issues like banning/locking incorrect heroes and skipping the process due to Faction mistakes (e.g. operational errors and the countdown ending). The match will proceed with the consequences borne by the Faction.\nIn a BO1 match, the system will randomly assign one side to ban a hero first.\nFor a BO3 or above match, the system will randomly assign one side to ban a hero first in the first match. The winner of each match will then ban first in the subsequent match.\nThe \"leader\" responsible for bans and locks will be selected from the Participants in the following order:\n1.\tFaction captain;\n2.\tFaction coach;\n3.\tThe first Participant in the preparation room;\n4.\tRandomly decided;\nIf the \"leader\" responsible for bans and locks goes offline during this process, the system will randomly assign another Participant as the new \"leader\". Therefore, all Participants should remain attentive during the process. Note: Even if the original \"leader\" reconnects, the ban & lock duty will remain with the newly assigned Participant.\n\n<B>Map Selection Rules</>\nThe available maps for the Tournament stays in real-time sync with the available maps for Competitive mode. Please note that the available maps for each match may therefore change in real time.\nIn the open and closed qualifiers, the maps and initial sides for all matches will be randomly decided by the system.\nIn the double-elimination stage, the map and initial sides for a round's first match will be randomly decided by the system. From the second match onward, if the selected map involves attack and defense, the loser from the previous match will start as the attacker.\nFrom the second match onward, the system will prioritize a map that is different from the previous one.\n\n<B>Open Qualifiers Rules</>\nThe open qualifiers will run from August 9, 2025, to August 10, 2025.\nBelow is the open qualifiers matchmaking schedule for each region:\n\nCHINA PC Region:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+8) on August 9, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+8) on August 10, 2025;\n\nAMERICAS PC/Console Region:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC-5) on August 9, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC-5) on August 10, 2025;\n\nEMEA PC/Console Region:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+2) on August 9, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+2) on August 10, 2025;\n\nPACIFIC PC/Console Region:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+9) on August 9, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+9) on August 10, 2025;\n\nDuring the matchmaking period in the registered region, the Faction captain or coach forms a team with members and starts the open qualifiers matchmaking. The system then randomly pairs Factions for the Tournament. The \"team\" refers to the in-game teaming system, where either the Faction captain or coach must lead and select the \"Tournament\" mode. When the leader accesses open qualifiers matchmaking through the Championship page, the system will automatically assist in selecting the \"Tournament\" matchmaking mode. The leader can also manually navigate to the mode selection page to choose the \"Tournament\" matchmaking mode. Note: This matchmaking mode will be unavailable if the Faction is not participating, it is not within the scheduled period, or the matchmaking limit has been reached.\nOpen qualifiers adopt a BO1 format. The system randomly selects a map from the competitive map pool at the start of the season and randomly decides the Faction sides.\nEach Faction can complete up to 10 open qualifiers. Any open qualifier completed counts toward the Faction's ranking.\nEach open qualifier grants 3 points to the winner and 0 points to the loser. Ties do not earn points or count toward the total number of open qualifiers. After the open qualifiers end, all Factions will be ranked based on their points. In the event of multiple Factions having the same points, rankings will be determined in the following order until the tie is broken:\n1.\tThe Faction with more matches completed is ranked higher;\n2.\tThe Faction with a shorter total time for wins is ranked higher;\n3.\tThe Faction with more kills is ranked higher;\n4.\tThe Faction with higher total DMG is ranked higher;\n5.\tIn case of a complete tie, rankings will be decided randomly;\nLate matchmaking may result in long waits or issues finding an opponent. This is common and could impact the Faction's chances of advancing. It is recommended to start open qualifiers matchmaking early.\nThe top 128 Factions in the open qualifiers directly advance to the double-elimination stage.\nFactions ranked No. 129-512 in the open qualifiers advance to the closed qualifiers.\nNote: Rankings in the open and closed qualifiers will impact the initial matchups in the double-elimination stage. For more details, please refer to the double-elimination stage rules.\n\n<B>Closed Qualifier Rules</>\nThe closed qualifiers will run from August 16, 2025, to August 17, 2025.\nBelow is the closed qualifier matchmaking schedule for each region:\n\nCHINA PC Region:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+8) on August 16, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+8) on August 17, 2025;\n\nAMERICAS PC/Console Region:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC-5) on August 16, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC-5) on August 17, 2025;\n\nEMEA PC/Console Region:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+2) on August 16, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+2) on August 17, 2025;\n\nPACIFIC PC/Console Region:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+9) on August 16, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+9) on August 17, 2025;\n\nDuring the matchmaking period in the registered region, the Faction captain or coach forms a team with members and starts the closed qualifiers matchmaking. The system then randomly pairs Factions for the Tournament. The \"team\" refers to the in-game teaming system, where either the Faction captain or coach must lead and select the \"Tournament\" mode. When the leader accesses closed qualifiers matchmaking through the Championship page, the system will automatically assist in selecting the \"Tournament\" matchmaking mode. The leader can also manually navigate to the mode selection page to choose the \"Tournament\" matchmaking mode. Note: This matchmaking mode will be unavailable if the Faction is not participating, it is not within the scheduled period, or the matchmaking limit has been reached.\nClosed qualifiers adopt a BO1 format. The system randomly selects a map from the competitive map pool at the start of the season and randomly decides the Faction sides.\nEach Faction can complete up to 10 closed qualifiers. Any closed qualifier completed counts toward the Faction's ranking.\nEach closed qualifier grants 3 points to the winner and 0 points to the loser. Ties do not earn points or count toward the total number of closed qualifiers. After the closed qualifiers end, all Factions will be ranked based on their points. In the event of multiple Factions having the same points, rankings will be determined in the following order until the tie is broken:\n1.\tThe Faction with more matches completed is ranked higher;\n2.\tThe Faction with a shorter total time for wins is ranked higher;\n3.\tThe Faction with more kills is ranked higher;\n4.\tThe Faction with higher total DMG is ranked higher;\n5.\tIn case of a complete tie, rankings will be decided randomly;\nLate matchmaking may result in long waits or issues finding an opponent. This is common and could impact the Faction's chances of advancing. It is recommended to start closed qualifiers matchmaking early.\nThe top 128 Factions in the closed qualifiers advance to the double-elimination stage.\nNote: Rankings in the open and closed qualifiers will impact the initial matchups in the double-elimination stage. For more details, please refer to the double-elimination stage rules.\n\n<B>Double-Elimination Stage Rules</>\nThe initial Faction limit for this Championship - Double-Elimination Stage is 256, with 128 from the open qualifiers and another 128 from the closed qualifiers.\nThe double-elimination stage will run for 3 weeks: from August 23, 2025, to August 24, 2025, from August 30, 2025, to August 31, 2025, and from September 6, 2025, to September 7, 2025.\nAbout an hour after the closed qualifiers end, the system will automatically generate the matchups for the double-elimination stage and the match start deadline for each round.\nThe matchups for round 1 will be based on the rankings upon advancement. The 128 Factions from the open qualifiers will be ranked No. 1-128, and the 128 Factions from the closed qualifiers will be ranked No. 129-256. The Tournament system will first spread out the higher-ranked Factions.\nFactions advancing to the double-elimination stage should promptly check the \"Tournament\" page for the matchups and match start deadlines for each round.\nBelow is the match start deadline for each double-elimination stage. Any matches that have not started by then will automatically begin.\n\nCHINA PC Region:\n1.\tIgnition Round (256 Factions): August 23, 2025 at 14:00 (UTC+8)\n2.\tRound 2 (128 Factions in the upper

20:00 (UTC+9)\n\nOnce the matchups for each double-elimination stage are fully announced, the Factions can schedule their matches before the match start deadline. It is recommended for two Factions to pick an early match time. When any 6 members from each side are ready for the double-elimination stage in the preparation room, the system will automatically start the countdown and start the match early. Note: Multiple matches in the same round will run consecutively.\nOnce the Tournament begins, all matches in an elimination round (BO3/BO5/BO7) will run consecutively without long pauses. Factions will have a 15-minute break between matches, after which, the system will automatically start the next match. During the break, the 12 members from both sides can prepare and start the next match in advance.\nNotes: If a Faction does not start the match before the \"match start deadline\" for each round, the system will automatically force the match to begin at that time. If a Faction has fewer than 6 members at this time, the system will automatically declare the other Faction as the winner, and they will advance to the next stage. If both Factions lack members, the system will randomly select a winner to advance.\nNotes: Whether the match starts early or is forced to start by the system, all BO3, BO5, and BO7 matches will be played consecutively, with a 15-minute break between each game.\nFrom the second match onward in a double-elimination stage, if a Faction has fewer than 6 members upon the match start deadline, the system will automatically declare the other Faction as the winner to advance (not just for that match, but for the entire round). If both Factions lack members, the system will randomly select a winner to advance (not just for that match, but for the entire round).\nByes may occur during the double-elimination stage. When one Faction has a bye, it will automatically advance. A matchup with no Factions grants no qualification.\nBefore each double-elimination stage and during breaks between matches, Factions are free to adjust the Participants in the room. However, always keep an eye on the \"match start deadline\". If a Faction has fewer than 6 members in the room at this time, the system will eliminate this Faction and declare the other Faction as the winner, which will then advance to the next stage.\nThe Faction captain and coach can be absent from the preparation room in the double-elimination stage. The match can start as long as there are 6 Participants in the room.\nThe Tournament will use BO3 for rounds 1-9, BO5 for rounds 10-14, BO5 for the lower bracket finals, and BO7 for the finals.\n\n<B>Tournament Guide</>\nThe match results and data are mainly determined by the Tournament system. In case of any major disputes, the Official Organization's decision will prevail.\nEach match will be played on the latest game version, which may be updated during the Tournament.\nParticipants should prepare their gaming devices and solve any network issues beforehand. A stable wired network is recommended. Please set up the network in advance. Participants are responsible for any network or device issues during the Tournament.\nThe Official Organization requires Participants to cooperate when checking devices and network IP addresses.\nFactions can replace Participants with other registered members before and between matches, but temporary substitutes are not permitted. If a Faction has fewer than 6 members in the preparation room by the elimination stage's match start deadline, it will be considered a forfeit for that round. If both Factions have fewer than 6 members in the preparation room, the system will automatically select a winner to advance. The system will automatically start matches under two conditions:\n1.\tFactions do not start matches before the match start deadline;\n2.\tFactions do not start the next match after the break (between BO3/BO5/BO7 elimination matches) ends;\nAfter entering the double-elimination stage, team captains must join the official captain group on the designated platform to stay updated on the latest information and promptly communicate any disputes or issues during the Tournament.\n\n<B>Issue Resolution</>\nIn this Tournament, there will be no pauses or rematches during the open qualifiers, closed qualifiers, and double-elimination stage. Participants should manage their network connection and ensure its stability. If disconnected, Players can use the \"Reconnect\" feature to quickly rejoin the game. Since this is not a Tournament-specific feature, the Official Organization does not guarantee its effectiveness or stability and is not responsible for failed reconnections. The Official Organization will not handle complaints about disconnections due to network issues. Using boosters, changing nodes, or disconnecting may lead to unstable connections, disconnections, or failing to reconnect. The Official Organization will hold no responsibility for such outcomes.\nIn rare cases, if the game server fails to record match results, the Tournament system will automatically take the following actions: For the open and closed qualifiers, the match count and points will remain unchanged. Affected Factions can continue competing within the matchmaking period. For the double-elimination stage, unrecorded match results will be ignored, and points will remain unchanged. However, the system will proceed with the break and the next match until the BO3/BO5/BO7 results are confirmed. Factions should pay attention to Tournament notices and participate in matches promptly.\nThe in-game system is responsible for scheduling matches and determining match results. The results of the sign-up stage, open qualifiers, closed qualifiers, and double-elimination stage will be based on the data automatically generated by the Tournament system. In case of major disruptions, the Official Organization has the right to switch to manual mode and coordinate the remaining schedule through a custom room and captain group. If this change is needed, the Official Organization will notify the captain group promptly. Once manual mode is activated, all match results will be announced by the Official Organization.\n\n<B>Objections/Complaints Rules</>\nThe Official Organization is the highest authority for this Tournament. For any major disputes during the Tournament, the Participants involved must submit evidence. If a new round has started, or more than 6 hours have passed since the end of the match, the Official Organization will no longer accept any appeals for that match.\nThe complainant must be a member of the participating Faction, and the involved Participants must promptly provide evidence.\nBelow is the standard procedure for objections/complaints: The involved Participants save evidence and submit it to the Official Organization through the captain group or other official channels. Afterward, the Official Organization investigates and announces the results.\nOnce the complaint is accepted, the Official Organization will immediately conduct an investigation, and collect, analyze, and examine the evidence on the principles of transparency, fairness, and justice. All Participants must report truthfully. If a Participant conceals information or misleads the Official Organization to hinder the investigation, both the Participant and their Faction will be penalized.\nThe Official Organization will then make a ruling based on the facts and rules. The decision will be announced through the captain group or other official channels. After the official investigation results are announced, Participants cannot raise objections. But if new and more accurate evidence arises with substantial objections to the original decision, the Official Organization may consider reopening the complaint.\nActions that follow in-game match and Tournament Rules, such as character selection, map use, and kill methods, will not be accepted for complaints.\n\n<B>Code of Conduct for Participants</>\nThis Tournament aims to provide an exciting competitive experience for all Participants yearning for victory. The Official Organization strives to create a fair environment for all Participants, ensuring the value of each match. To create a fair gaming environment, we insist there should be no cheating, system abuse, harassment, or other actions that prevent Participants from performing to the best of their abilities.\nParticipants should address conflicts with mutual respect, avoiding physical/mental violence, threats, or intimidation. Violence against other Participants, fans, judges, official staff, or anyone else is strictly forbidden at all times.\nThe following actions will be considered violations, and the Official Organization has the right to impose penalties such as verbal warnings, rematches, disqualifications from matches/rounds, or forfeitures of prizes/rewards if the actions disrupt the fairness of the game or are deemed inappropriate:\n1.\tFailing to use the designated device to compete;\n2.\tPassive gameplay or illegally obtaining confidential information from other Factions (including but not limited to screen information, internal voices, internal chats, or tactical secrets);\n3.\tUsing any game bugs to gain an advantage, unless explicitly allowed by the Official Organization (Participants are obligated to promptly report any bugs encountered during the Tournament and avoid using them);\n4.\tColluding, fixing matches, or committing acts that severely affect other Participants;\n5.\tMaking inappropriate remarks, spamming excessively, or disrupting the Tournament or livestream in the Tournament area, livestreams, group chats, or in-game chats;\n6.\tModifying the game client in any way;\n7.\tUsing cheat devices and/or programs, or any similar cheating methods (signal devices, macro commands, emulators, XIM, etc.);\n8.\tUsing another Participant's account, or hiring/encouraging/guiding others to use another Participant's account to compete;\n9.\tThreatening, insulting, attacking, bribing, provoking, harassing, or defaming staff of the Official Organization or other Participants;\n10.\tPosting discriminatory or offensive comments about gender, race, religion, political views, financial status, etc. in any form in the Tournament area, livestreams, group chats, or in-game chats;\n11.\tInciting or promoting hate/discrimination in any form in the Tournament area, livestreams, group chats, or in-game chats;\n12.\tEngaging in behavior that violates the User Agreement, Privacy Policy, or any applicable community guidelines/rules.\n\n<B>Rule Changes & Improvements</>\nTo ensure fairness and integrity in the Tournament, the Official Organization reserves the right to revise, amend, or supplement these Rules as needed.\nFor major changes, the Official Organization will notify Participants before the next event or match where the new rules apply. By participating in subsequent events or matches, Participants are deemed to have accepted the revised rules.\nThe officially published rules shall prevail in case of any inconsistency with official communications.\nThe Official Organization has the right to take any necessary measures without restriction to protect the interests of Marvel Rivals, its affiliates, individuals or entities providing products or services for the Tournament, individuals or entities authorized to create and/or release media content during the Tournament, and individuals attending Tournament-related events. All decisions made by the Official Organization are final.\nThe Official Organization reserves the right to interpret all provisions of these Rules and to determine penalties for violations.\n\n<B>Prizes</>\nA specific prize pool is set for this Tournament, with all prizes listed in \"Tournament Prizes\" being pre-tax.\nWinners are responsible for any taxes or fees related to the prizes. Winners agree that the Official Organization will withhold and prepay the individual income tax and any other relevant taxes (if any) according to the law, and will deduct them from the prizes. For additional taxes that are incurred during personal income tax filing, the responsibility lies with the winners, not the Official Organization.\nAfter the Tournament ends, the Official Organization will contact the winning Factions for prize distribution. Winners must follow the official procedure to sign a prize claim form.\nThe Official Organization has the right to disqualify players who repeatedly participate in the same Tournament, and to refuse to award prizes to winning Factions that contain rule-violating Participants.\nUnless otherwise agreed upon in writing, a prize will be equally divided among all Faction members listed at the registration deadline, regardless of their participation in the Tournament.\nPrizes cannot be transferred or redeemed for other rewards. If a particular prize is unavailable, the Official Organization has the right to replace it with an equivalent or higher-value prize. Unless the Official Organization permits other payment methods, all cash rewards in the China PC Region will be paid in RMB, while all cash rewards in other regions will be paid in USD. Potential prize winners are responsible for all liabilities for the use of the prizes.\nPlease note that if your faction does not complete at least one match during the elimination stage, your faction will not be eligible for faction rewards, and faction members will not receive any virtual rewards, cash prizes, or physical rewards. It will be considered valid participation if a match in the elimination stage is completed normally, or if your faction's six members are in the elimination stage preparation room and automatically advance due to the opponent's incomplete attendance.\nNote: Marvel/Disney is neither a sponsor of this Tournament nor the provider of the prizes.\n\n<B>Tournament Prizes</>\nChina PC Region (Faction Prizes, in CNY):\n1.\tChampion: ¥40,000\n2.\tRunner-up: ¥20,000\n3.\tThird Place: ¥10,000\n4.\tFourth Place: ¥6,000\n5.\tNo. 5-8: ¥3,000 Per Faction\n6.\tNo. 9-16: ¥1,500 Per Faction\n\nAMERICAS PC/Console Region, EMEA PC/Console Region, PACIFIC PC/Console Region (Faction Prizes, in USD):\n1.\tChampion: $6,000\n2.\tRunner-up: $3,000\n3.\tThird Place: $1,500\n4.\tFourth Place: $800\n5.\tNo. 5-8: $400 Per Faction\n6.\tNo. 9-16: $200 Per Faction\n\n<B>Virtual Rewards</>\nThis Tournament offers in-game virtual rewards for Marvel Rivals.

    "Common_Clash_Rule_Oversea": "<B>Marvel Rivals Clash</>\n<B>Tournament System Rules</>\n\n<B>Summary</>\nThe \"Marvel Rivals Clash\" (hereinafter referred to as \"The Clash\") is an in-game tournament system of Marvel Rivals. The Clash itself does not refer to any specific tournament. Through the Marvel Rivals Clash System, NetEase and its affiliated companies (collectively referred to as the \"Official Organization\" or \"Committee\") will periodically host and operate Marvel Rivals tournaments. These \"Marvel Rivals Clash Tournament Rules \" (hereinafter referred to as \"Tournament Rules\" or \"These Rules\") establish the general guidelines and restrictions governing the Marvel Rivals Clash System. All factions and players (collectively referred to as \"Participants\") must thoroughly review the specific tournament rules for each individual tournament within the Marvel Rivals Clash System before participating. The specific tournament rules serve as an agreement between all Participants and the Official Organization, detailing the general rules for participation, including eligibility, tournament structure, division of competition groups, prize distribution, and player conduct. Additionally, these rules define liability limitations, licensing terms, and other legally enforceable contractual provisions. Before participating in any tournament, each Participant must carefully read, understand, and agree to the corresponding tournament rules.\n\n<B>Clash Faction</>\nA Clash faction is the smallest unit required to participate in individual tournaments within the Marvel Rivals Clash System. A Clash faction is independent and has no connection to regular factions required for the Marvel Rivals Championship. Before participating in a Marvel Rivals Clash Tournament, players can independently create a Clash faction and recruit members, without needing to worry about their own or their faction members' participation status in regular factions, roster locks, or other restrictions. However, Participants should be mindful of potential scheduling conflicts across multiple tournaments. The Official Organization is not responsible for any consequences arising from overlapping schedules, such as missed matches.\nEach Clash faction is tied to a specific tournament group. To participate in a different tournament group, Participants must create a separate Clash faction. Clash factions are independent of each other, and their participation, roster locks, and other processes do not affect one another.\nThe classification of tournament groups is determined by the rules of each Clash Tournament.\nAny faction-based rewards earned in specific Clash Tournaments within the Marvel Rivals Clash System, such as Faction Trophies or Faction Banners, will be awarded to the Clash faction that participated in the tournament. These rewards cannot be transferred between Clash factions or between a Clash faction and a regular faction.\n\n<B>Platform Visibility Restrictions</>\nSome Marvel Rivals Clash Tournaments may have platform visibility restrictions, in addition to participation restrictions based on the platform. These tournaments will only be visible to players who log in and play on the platforms eligible for registration. Players from other platforms will neither be able to see nor participate in the tournament.\n\n<B>Rule Changes and Improvements</>\nTo ensure fairness and integrity, the Official Organization reserves the right to revise, modify, or supplement these rules at any time based on the circumstances.\nIn the event of any conflict between communications with the Official Organization and the officially published rules, the officially published rules shall prevail.\nIf there is a conflict between these rules and the specific Clash Tournament rules within the Marvel Rivals Clash System, these rules shall take precedence.\nThe Official Organization has the authority to evaluate and impose penalties for violations committed by factions or participants.\n\n<B>Disclaimer</>\nAll tournaments within the Marvel Rivals Clash System are part of the official online tournaments. Any mention of Marvel Rivals-related prizes or brand names does not imply or constitute official endorsement by NetEase, Marvel, or Disney.\n",
    "Ignite_OpenQualifiers_Split1_Rules_GLO": "<B>Marvel Rivals Ignite</>\n<B>Stage 2 Open Qualifiers</>\n<B>Tournament Rules</>\n\nOfficial Rules v1.1\n\n<B>Summary</>\nThe \"Marvel Rivals Ignite Open Qualifiers\" (hereinafter referred to as \"the Tournament\") is a tournament hosted and operated by NetEase and its affiliated companies (collectively referred to as the \"Official Organization\" or \"Committee\"). UK NetEase Interactive Entertainment Limited is the operator of the Tournament. These \"Marvel Rivals Ignite Open Qualifiers Tournament Rules\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Tournament Rules\" or \"these Rules\") constitute an agreement between all Clash Factions and Players (collectively referred to as \"Participants\") and the Official Organization, and outline the general provisions for participating in the Tournament. These include the eligibility, event structure, regional divisions, prize distribution, and player conduct guidelines, as well as limitations of liability, licensing terms, and other legally binding contractual terms. Before participating, each Participant must carefully read, understand, and agree to these Rules.\nThe game version may differ across regions due to the requirements of local laws, regulations, and policies.\nAll Participants must agree to these Rules in order to participate in the Tournament. Any of the following actions indicates that the Participant accepts these Rules:\n1.\tSuccessfully registering and participating in the Tournament;\n2.\tParticipating in any match related to the Tournament;\n3.\tSigning a participation confirmation form, either in paper or electronic format;\nThe tournament schedule is divided into two splits, with periods set for each region's local time from August 1, 2025, to August 17, 2025, and from August 18, 2025, to August 24, 2025. Each phase consists of three stages: registration, open qualifiers, and single-elimination matches, with a designated percentage of slots allocated for advancement from the group stages.\nThe Tournament aims to provide a public registration and competitive channel for the group stage of the Marvel Rivals Ignite Stage 2 across various regions. To effectively obtain eligibility for the group stage, participating clash factions must ensure that all members comply with the requirements regarding team size, competitive rank, age restrictions, and proof of identity corresponding to their region, among other regulations. Clash Factions that do not adhere to these rules will be ineligible to register for the tournament or to qualify for the group stage of the Marvel Rivals Ignite Stage 2.\n\n<B>Term Definitions</>\n1.\tRound: Refers to a series of matches with a group or elimination format that impacts the points or qualification of Participants. It typically refers to the total number of matches in a series, such as a best-of-three (BO3), best-of-five (BO5), best-of-seven (BO7), or best-of-nine (BO9), where all matchups are included.\n2.\tMatch: Refers to the smallest unit of a game, starting from the game loading and ending when the final result of the match is displayed. In a BO1 contest, one round is equivalent to one match.\n3.\tMatch Start Deadline: In a single-elimination stage, to ensure that participating Clash Factions can choose the most suitable match time based on friendly negotiation with their opponents, a \"match start deadline\" mechanism has been introduced. The \"match start deadline\" only restricts the latest automatically enforced start time for each round. If the competing Clash Factions fail to reach an agreement on the start time in advance and do not start the round early, the \"match start deadline\" will take effect. For further details, please refer to the \"Single-Elimination Stage Rules\" section.

The Official Organization reserves the right to impose restrictions on the Participant's in-game name and request changes for any non-compliant names. If a Participant's in-game name is offensive or inappropriate, or the Participant makes improper or insulting use of the intellectual property of NetEase, Marvel, Disney, or any third party, or the name is otherwise deemed inappropriate by the Official Organization, the Official Organization reserves the right to enforce a mandatory name change or disqualify the Participant based on the severity of the situation.\nThe Participant's name must not contain personal information, such as gender, race, religion, political views, financial status, or any other sensitive content.\nIn certain periods of the Tournament, Participants' names may be temporarily locked without prior notice, and Participants will not be able to modify their names during this period.\nDuring the Tournament, the Official Organization may temporarily disable the name of a Participant or force the Participant to modify their in-game name without prior notice.\n\n<B>Clash Factions</>\nPlayers can form Clash Factions to participate via the in-game Faction system, which is located in the Marvel Rivals Clash system under the Tournament section of the game.\nThe Clash Faction Name and Clash Faction Tag are the primary identifiers of Clash Factions.

Before the registration deadline, Clash Factions that have successfully registered can voluntarily cancel their registration, adjust their members, and re-submit their registration application. There is a limit to the number of times a Clash Faction can voluntarily cancel their registration. For more details, please refer to the \"Registration Rules\" section.\n\n<B>Platforms</>\nThe Tournament will only take place on PC, it encompasses five regions: the Americas, EMEA, Mainland China, Asia and Oceania. The Tournaments in different regions will be independent from each other.\nThe Tournament does not support cross-platform participation. Therefore, Players from different platforms cannot join the same Clash Faction.\n\n<B>Livestreams</>\nParticipants can livestream their gameplay during the Tournament.\nParticipants must not make any illegal, disrespectful, or inappropriate comments towards other Players or Participants during livestreams.\nParticipants who choose to livestream their matches should set an appropriate delay to prevent opponents from stream-sniping.

The Official Organization will continuously monitor for violations and disqualify any Participants found to be breaching this rule.\nThe Official Organization may require Participants suspected of violating the above equipment usage rules to record their screen and hands during all subsequent matches. These recording files must be submitted within 6 hours after the end of each round and before the start of the next round, through the method specified by the Official Organization. Participants who refuse this request may be considered by the Official Organization as having violated the equipment usage rules or as engaging in the use of cheats or third-party software. The Official Organization reserves the right to determine the appropriate actions to be taken against such Participants. When making recordings, Participants should clearly display their monitors (if multiple monitors are used, the recording should include all monitors), their keyboard and mouse/controller, their hands, and the actions performed on their equipment.

The Official Organization's actions may include, based on the severity of the situation, verbal warnings, disqualification from the current match, disqualification from the current round, removal from the Clash Faction, temporary suspension, permanent suspension, disqualification of the Clash Faction, and restriction of prize eligibility.\n\n<B>Regions</>\nThe tournament comprises the following five regions, which operate independently within the schedule. A participating clash faction may only choose to compete in one region in the Tournament:\n1.\tMainland China Region: Mainland China | Note: The players from Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR and Chinese Taipei are not considered foreign player when joining the Mainland China region teams for competition.\n2.\tAmericas Region: United States, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Panama, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Jamaica, The Bahamas, Honduras, Nicaragua, Dominica, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Venezuela, Bolivia, Uruguay, Ecuador.\n3.\tEurope, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) Region: Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Poland, Ukraine, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, North Macedonia, Moldova, Slovakia, Slovenia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Algeria, Morocco, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Israel, Cyprus, Tunisia, Kazakhstan, Georgia.\n4.\tAsia Region: Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR, Chinese Taipei, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore.\n5.\tOceania Region: Australia, New Zealand.\nThe Committee reserves the right to determine the eligibility and designated region of participation for any competitor not belonging to the aforementioned regions.\nEach region is open for registration exclusively to players who possess valid identification corresponding to the respective region. Additionally, each participating team may include a maximum of two foreign players who do not belong to the registering region. Please ensure that all members of your participating team comply with this limitation; otherwise, your team will be ineligible to qualify for subsequent events through the open qualifiers.\nIt is prohibited for a player to use multiple accounts to join one or more regions repeatedly in the Tournament. If discovered, the Committee will remove the Player's registration or participation progress in all regions and reserves the right to take actions including, but not limited to, refusing to award event prizes or virtual item rewards, requesting the return of any issued event prizes, reclaiming awarded virtual items, and permanently banning the Player from participating in future Marvel Rivals events.\n\n<B>Registration Rules</>\nThe Official Organization does not require Players to provide identification or other personal information to participate, but this may be requested if it is necessary to verify compliance with the rules.\nThe open qualifiers for the Tournament consist of two splits, with a specified number of slots available for advancement to Stage 2 of Marvel Rivals Ignite in each split. All clash factions that may be eligible for advancement will undergo a manual review by the committee to ensure compliance with restrictions pertaining to age, region, number of foreign players, competitive mode rankings, anti-cheat reviews, and other relevant criteria for participation.\nBelow is the registration schedule of the 2 splits for each region in the Tournament:\n\nMainland CHINA Region:\n1.\tSplit 1 - Registration Open: August 1, 2025 at 20:00 (UTC+8);\n2.\tSplit 1 - Registration Close: August 14, 2025 at 18:00 (UTC+8);\n3.\tSplit 2 - Registration Open: August 18, 2025 at 0:00 (UTC+8);\n4.\tSplit 2 - Registration Close: August 21, 2025 at 18:00 (UTC+8);\n\nAMERICAS Region:\n1.\tSplit 1 - Registration Open: August 1, 2025 at 20:00 (UTC-4);\n2.\tSplit 1 - Registration Close: August 14, 2025 at 18:00 (UTC-4);\n3.\tSplit 2 - Registration Open: August 18, 2025 at 0:00 (UTC-4);\n4.\tSplit 2 - Registration Close: August 21, 2025 at 18:00 (UTC-4);\n\nEMEA Region:\n1.\tSplit 1 - Registration Open: August 1, 2025 at 20:00 (UTC+2);\n2.\tSplit 1 - Registration Close: August 14, 2025 at 18:00 (UTC+2);\n3.\tSplit 2 - Registration Open: August 18, 2025 at 0:00 (UTC+2);\n4.\tSplit 2 - Registration Close: August 21, 2025 at 18:00 (UTC+2);\n\nASIA Region:\n1.\tSplit 1 - Registration Open: August 1, 2025 at 20:00 (UTC+9);\n2.\tSplit 1 - Registration Close: August 14, 2025 at 18:00 (UTC+9);\n3.\tSplit 2 - Registration Open: August 18, 2025 at 0:00 (UTC+9);\n4.\tSplit 2 - Registration Close: August 21, 2025 at 18:00 (UTC+9);\n\nOCEANIA Region:\n1.\tSplit 1 - Registration Open: August 1, 2025 at 20:00 (UTC+10);\n2.\tSplit 1 - Registration Close: August 14, 2025 at 18:00 (UTC+10);\n3.\tSplit 2 - Registration Open: August 18, 2025 at 0:00 (UTC+10);\n4.\tSplit 2 - Registration Close: August 21, 2025 at 18:00 (UTC+10);\n\nThe Tournament requires a minimum rank of Grandmaster 3 for registration. For registration, all Clash Faction members must have reached the required rank in the relevant season's competitive mode.\nClash Faction registration limit for each split of the Tournament: 512 Clash Factions/Region\nPlayers must register through the \"Tournament-Marvel Rivals Clash\" page in the game. There are no other channels available.\nAll eligible Players can register. Clash Factions must be formed through the in-game \"Clash Faction\" system. Once the captain or coach ensures that all Clash Faction members meet the platform and rank requirements for registration, they can register on the Marvel Rivals Clash page under the \"Tournament\" section. After the sign-up stage starts, the captain or coach will automatically approve it. Registration is successful once all Clash Faction members confirm on the \"Tournament\" page.\nRegistration will fail if there are any unconfirmed Clash Faction members before the deadline of the sign-up stage.\nDuring the sign-up stage confirmation period, the Clash Faction captain can freely add or remove members. Registration will be successful as soon as all members confirm. If the removal or voluntary exit of members reduces the Clash Faction size below 6 members, registration will immediately stop and fail.\nNotes: Once registration is successful or deadline of the sign-up stage arrives, Clash Factions cannot add, remove, or change members. Be sure to check the member list before registration. Once registration is complete, the Official Organization will not handle any member change requests. If a registered Clash Faction has more than 6 members, they are free to decide the lineup before each match. Clash Factions are advised to include enough substitutes in case of an emergency.\nBefore the deadline, Clash Factions can cancel their registration twice. The Clash Faction captain can initiate a cancellation at any time, and it will be successful once a majority of members confirm.\nIf any Clash Faction cancel their registration before the deadline, the number of registered Clash Factions will decrease accordingly.\nIf all members have confirmed registration but the Clash Faction count is full, the Clash Faction will fail to register.\nRegistered Clash Factions must ensure that their name, tag, and announcement are appropriate without any illegal content, infringements of personal rights, improper/offensive use of copyrights, or improper references to gender/race/religion/political views/financial status. Depending on the severity of the infraction, non-compliant Clash Factions will be renamed or disqualified without further notice.\nThe Mainland China Region is open only to players aged 18 and above. Other regions are open only to players aged 16 and above. Participants who are 16 years old but are still regarded as minors at the time of registering must submit a fully signed guardian consent form to the Official Organization before they can participate (the legal adult age will be determined according to the legal requirements of the Participant's country of nationality). The date of the registration deadline will serve as the reference for age. All Clash Faction captains, coaches, and members must meet the age requirement to participate. Note: Clash Factions with Participants under the required age will be disqualified, forfeiting any prizes and/or in-game rewards. The captain must check each member's real age and make sure they meet the age requirement.\nAll members of any team that has already qualified for the group stage of Stage 2 of the Marvel Rivals Ignite are prohibited from participating in both splits of the Tournament. Additionally, clash factions that successfully advance through the first split of the Tournament are also prohibited from participating in the second split of the Tournament.\n\n<B>Ban-Lock Process</>\nAll matches in the Tournament follow a captain ban & lock process, which occurs as follows:\n1.\tClash Faction A bans a hero;\n2.\tClash Faction B bans a hero;\n3.\tClash Faction B locks a hero;\n4.\tClash Faction A locks a hero;\n5.\tClash Faction A bans a hero;\n6.\tClash Faction B bans a hero;\n7.\tClash Faction B locks a hero;\n8.\tClash Faction A locks a hero;\n9.\tClash Faction A bans a hero;\n10.\tClash Faction B bans a hero;\nLocked heroes cannot be banned later.\nCaptains can choose not to ban or lock heroes. The process will be skipped after the countdown ends.\nAfter the ban & lock process ends, up to 6 heroes will be banned from the match. Participants can then choose other heroes from those available.\nThe Official Organization will not handle issues like banning/locking incorrect heroes and skipping the process due to Clash Faction mistakes (e.g. operational errors and the countdown ending). The match will proceed with the consequences borne by the Clash Faction.\nIn a BO1 match, the system will randomly assign one side to ban a hero first.\nFor a BO3 or above match, the system will randomly assign one side to ban a hero first in the first match. The loser of each match will then ban first in the subsequent match.\nThe \"leader\" responsible for bans and locks will be selected from the Participants in the following order:\n1.\tClash Faction captain;\n2.\tClash Faction coach;\n3.\tThe first Participant in the preparation room;\n4.\tRandomly decided;\nIf the \"leader\" responsible for bans and locks goes offline during this process, the system will randomly assign another Participant as the new \"leader\". Therefore, all Participants should remain attentive during the process. Note: Even if the original \"leader\" reconnects, the ban & lock duty will remain with the newly assigned Participant.\n\n<B>Map Selection Rules</>\nThe available maps for the Tournament stays in real-time sync with the available maps for Competitive mode. Please note that the available maps for each match may therefore change in real time.\nIn the open qualifiers, the maps and initial sides for all matches will be randomly decided by the system.\nIn single elimination stages, for the first match of a round, the map and initial side selection will be randomly determined by the system. Starting from the second match, if the selected map has attack-defense features (such as Convergence or Convoy mode maps), the losing side of the previous match will take the attacking role first.\nThe system will randomly prioritize a map that is different from the previous match for the second and subsequent matches within a round.\n\n<B>Open Qualifiers Rules</>\nThe open qualifiers will run from August 14 to August 15, 2025, and from August 21 to August 22, 2025.\nBelow is the open qualifiers matchmaking schedule for each region:\n\nMainland CHINA Region – Split 1:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+8) on August 14, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+8) on August 15, 2025;\n\nMainland CHINA Region – Split 2:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+8) on August 21, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+8) on August 22, 2025;\n\nAMERICAS Region – Split 1:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC-4) on August 14, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC-4) on August 15, 2025;\n\nAMERICAS Region – Split 2:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC-4) on August 21, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC-4) on August 22, 2025;\n\nEMEA Region – Split 1:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+2) on August 14, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+2) on August 15, 2025;\n\nEMEA Region – Split 2:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+2) on August 21, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+2) on August 22, 2025;\n\nASIA Region – Split 1:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+9) on August 14, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+9) on August 15, 2025;\n\nASIA Region – Split 2:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+9) on August 21, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+9) on August 22, 2025;\n\nOCEANIA Region – Split 1:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+10) on August 14, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+10) on August 15, 2025;\n\nOCEANIA Region – Split 2:\n1.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+10) on August 21, 2025;\n2.\t19:00-23:00 (UTC+10) on August 22, 2025;\n\nDuring the matchmaking period in the registered region, the Clash Faction captain or coach forms a team with members and starts the open qualifiers matchmaking. The system then randomly pairs Clash Factions for the Tournament. The \"team\" refers to the in-game teaming system, where either the Clash Faction captain or coach must lead and select the \"Tournament\" mode. When the leader accesses open qualifiers matchmaking through the Marvel Rivals Clash page, the system will automatically assist in selecting the \"Tournament\" matchmaking mode. The leader can also manually navigate to the mode selection page to choose the \"Tournament\" matchmaking mode. Note: This matchmaking mode will be unavailable if the Clash Faction is not participating, it is not within the scheduled period, or the matchmaking limit has been reached.\nOpen qualifiers adopt a BO1 format. The system randomly selects a map from the competitive map pool at the start of the season and randomly decides the Clash Faction sides.\nEach Clash Faction can complete up to 10 open qualifiers. Any open qualifier completed counts toward the Clash Faction's ranking.\nEach open qualifier grants 3 points to the winner and 0 points to the loser. Ties do not earn points or count toward the total number of open qualifiers. After the open qualifiers end, all Clash Factions will be ranked based on their points. In the event of multiple Clash Factions having the same points, rankings will be determined in the following order until the tie is broken:\n1.\tThe Clash Faction with more matches completed is ranked higher;\n2.\tThe Clash Faction with a shorter total time for wins is ranked higher;\n3.\tThe Clash Faction with more kills is ranked higher;\n4.\tThe Clash Faction with higher total DMG is ranked higher;\n5.\tIn case of a complete tie, rankings will be decided randomly;\nLate matchmaking may result in long waits or issues finding an opponent. This is common and could impact the Clash Faction's chances of advancing. It is recommended to start open qualifiers matchmaking early.\nThe top 32 Clash Factions in the open qualifiers advance to the single-elimination stage.\n\n<B>Single-Elimination Stage Rules</>\nThe initial Clash Faction limit for each split of the Tournament - single-elimination stage is 32.\nThe single-elimination stage of the two splits of the Tournament will run from August 16 to August 17, 2025, and from August 23 to August 24, 2025.\nAbout an hour after the open qualifiers end, the system will automatically generate the matchups for the single-elimination stage and the match start deadline for each round.\nThe matchups for round 1 will be based on the rankings upon advancement. The Tournament system will first spread out the higher-ranked Clash Factions.\nClash Factions advancing to the single-elimination stage should promptly check the \"Tournament-Marvel Rivals Clash\" page for the matchups and match start deadlines for each round.\nBelow is the match start deadline for each single-elimination stage. Any matches that have not started by then will automatically begin.\n\nMainland CHINA Region – Split 1:\n1.\t32 to 16: August 16, 2025 at 14:00 (UTC+8)\n2.\t16 to 8: August 16, 2025 at 17:00 (UTC+8)\n3.\tQuarterfinals: August 16, 2025 at 20:00 (UTC+8)\n4.\tSemifinals: August 17, 2025 at 14:00 (UTC+8)\n5.\tFinals: August 17, 2025 at 17:00 (UTC+8)\n6.\tThis split provides 2 slots for the group stage of the Marvel Rivals Ignite Stage 2 Mainland CHINA Region.\n\nMainland CHINA Region – Split 2:\n1.\t32 to 16: August 23, 2025 at 14:00 (UTC+8)\n2.\t16 to 8: August 23, 2025 at 17:00 (UTC+8)\n3.\tQuarterfinals: August 23, 2025 at 20:00 (UTC+8)\n4.\tSemifinals: August 24, 2025 at 14:00 (UTC+8)\n5.\tFinals: August 24, 2025 at 17:00 (UTC+8)\n6.\tThis split provides at least 2 slots for the group stage of the Marvel Rivals Ignite Stage 2 Mainland CHINA Region.

All participating teams are requested to set up their contact information through the in-game settings as soon as possible, so that the official can reach out to them.\n\nOCEANIA Region – Split 1:\n1.\t32 to 16: August 16, 2025 at 14:00 (UTC+10)\n2.\t16 to 8: August 16, 2025 at 17:00 (UTC+10)\n3.\tQuarterfinals: August 16, 2025 at 20:00 (UTC+10)\n4.\tSemifinals: August 17, 2025 at 14:00 (UTC+10)\n5.\tFinals: August 17, 2025 at 17:00 (UTC+10)\n6.\tThis split provides 2 slots for the group stage of the Marvel Rivals Ignite Stage 2 OCEANIA Region.\n\nOCEANIA Region – Split 2:\n1.\t32 to 16: August 23, 2025 at 14:00 (UTC+10)\n2.\t16 to 8: August 23, 2025 at 17:00 (UTC+10)\n3.\tQuarterfinals: August 23, 2025 at 20:00 (UTC+10)\n4.\tSemifinals: August 24, 2025 at 14:00 (UTC+10)\n5.\tFinals: August 24, 2025 at 17:00 (UTC+10)\n6.\tThis split provides at least 1 slots for the group stage of the Marvel Rivals Ignite Stage 2 OCENIA Region. If, after the conclusion of this split, the total number of slots for the Marvel Rivals Ignite Stage 2 OCEANIA Region is insufficient, the official will assess the need for supplemental slots and may manually organize additional open qualifiers. The official will base its invitations for participation in the additional open qualifiers on the rankings from the Open Qualifiers Split 2. The additional open qualifiers will be scheduled as soon as possible, and no later than September 7. All participating teams are requested to set up their contact information through the in-game settings as soon as possible, so that the official can reach out to them.\n\nOnce the matchups for each single-elimination stage are fully announced, the Clash Factions can schedule their matches before the match start deadline. It is recommended for two Clash Factions to pick an early match time. When any 6 members from each side are ready for the single-elimination stage in the preparation room, the system will automatically start the countdown and start the match early. Note: Multiple matches in the same round will run consecutively.\nOnce the Tournament begins, all matches in an elimination round (BO3/BO5/BO7) will run consecutively without long pauses. Clash Factions will have a 15-minute break between matches, after which, the system will automatically start the next match. During the break, the 12 members from both sides can prepare and start the next match in advance.\nNotes: If a Clash Faction does not start the match before the \"match start deadline\" for each round, the system will automatically force the match to begin at that time. If a Clash Faction has fewer than 6 members at this time, the system will automatically declare the other Clash Faction as the winner, and they will advance to the next stage. If both Clash Factions lack members, the system will randomly select a winner to advance.\nNotes: Whether the match starts early or is forced to start by the system, all BO3, BO5, and BO7 matches will be played consecutively, with a 15-minute break between each game.\nFrom the second match onward in a single-elimination stage, if a Clash Faction has fewer than 6 members upon the match start deadline, the system will automatically declare the other Clash Faction as the winner to advance (not just for that match, but for the entire round). If both Clash Factions lack members, the system will randomly select a winner to advance (not just for that match, but for the entire round).\nByes may occur during the single-elimination stage. When one Clash Faction has a bye, it will automatically advance. A matchup with no Clash Factions grants no qualification.\nBefore each single-elimination stage and during breaks between matches, Clash Factions are free to adjust the Participants in the room. However, always keep an eye on the \"match start deadline\". If a Clash Faction has fewer than 6 members in the room at this time, the system will eliminate this Clash Faction and declare the other Clash Faction as the winner, which will then advance to the next stage.\nThe Clash Faction captain and coach can be absent from the preparation room in the single-elimination stage. The match can start as long as there are 6 Participants in the room.\nAll matches leading up to the top eight in the single-elimination stage will adopt a Best of Three (BO3) format. Matches following the top eight will adopt a Best of Five (BO5) format. The single-elimination tournament will ultimately determine the slots for each region to qualify for the group stage of Stage 2 of Marvel Rivals Ignite. The number of slots for each region, as well as the respective advancement quantities from the two splits of open qualifiers within each region, will be subject to the latest announcements by the committee. Please note that the organizing committee will consider the final rankings of participating clash factions in the Tournament, the allocation of slots for each round in each region, the results of clash factions qualification reviews, and the participation or forfeiture status of other clash factions that have qualified.\n\n<B>Tournament Guide</>\nThe match results and data are mainly determined by the Tournament system. In case of any major disputes, the Official Organization's decision will prevail.\nEach match will be played on the latest game version, which may be updated during the Tournament.\nParticipants should prepare their gaming devices and solve any network issues beforehand. A stable wired network is recommended. Please set up the network in advance. Participants are responsible for any network or device issues during the Tournament.\nThe Official Organization requires Participants to cooperate when checking devices and network IP addresses.\nClash Factions can replace Participants with other registered members before and between matches, but temporary substitutes are not permitted. If a Clash Faction has fewer than 6 members in the preparation room by the elimination stage's match start deadline, it will be considered a forfeit for that round. If both Clash Factions have fewer than 6 members in the preparation room, the system will automatically select a winner to advance. The system will automatically start matches under two conditions:\n1.\tClash Factions do not start matches before the match start deadline;\n2.\tClash Factions do not start the next match after the break (between BO3/BO5/BO7 elimination matches) ends;\nAfter entering the single-elimination stage, team captains must join the official captain group on the designated platform to stay updated on the latest information and promptly communicate any disputes or issues during the Tournament.\n\n<B>Issue Resolution</>\nIn the Tournament, there will be no pauses or rematches during the open qualifiers, and single-elimination stage. Participants should manage their network connection and ensure its stability. If disconnected, Players can use the \"Reconnect\" feature to quickly rejoin the game. Since this is not a Tournament-specific feature, the Official Organization does not guarantee its effectiveness or stability and is not responsible for failed reconnections. The Official Organization will not handle complaints about disconnections due to network issues. Using boosters, changing nodes, or disconnecting may lead to unstable connections, disconnections, or failing to reconnect. The Official Organization will hold no responsibility for such outcomes.\nIn rare cases, if the game server fails to record match results, the Tournament system will automatically take the following actions: For the open qualifiers, the match count and points will remain unchanged. Affected Clash Factions can continue competing within the matchmaking period. For the single-elimination stage, unrecorded match results will be ignored, and points will remain unchanged. However, the system will proceed with the break and the next match until the BO3/BO5/BO7 results are confirmed. Clash Factions should pay attention to Tournament notices and participate in matches promptly.\nThe in-game system is responsible for scheduling matches and determining match results. The results of the sign-up stage, open qualifiers and single-elimination stage will be based on the data automatically generated by the Tournament system. In case of major disruptions, the Official Organization has the right to switch to manual mode and coordinate the remaining schedule through a custom room and captain group. If this change is needed, the Official Organization will notify the captain group promptly. Once manual mode is activated, all match results will be announced by the Official Organization.\n\n<B>Objections/Complaints Rules</>\nThe Official Organization is the highest authority for the Tournament. For any major disputes during the Tournament, the Participants involved must submit evidence. If a new round has started, or more than 6 hours have passed since the end of the match, the Official Organization will no longer accept any appeals for that match.\nThe complainant must be a member of the participating Clash Faction, and the involved Participants must promptly provide evidence.\nBelow is the standard procedure for objections/complaints: The involved Participants save evidence and submit it to the Official Organization through the captain group or other official channels. Afterward, the Official Organization investigates and announces the results.\nOnce the complaint is accepted, the Official Organization will immediately conduct an investigation, and collect, analyze, and examine the evidence on the principles of transparency, fairness, and justice. All Participants must report truthfully. If a Participant conceals information or misleads the Official Organization to hinder the investigation, both the Participant and their Clash Faction will be penalized.\nThe Official Organization will then make a ruling based on the facts and rules. The decision will be announced through the captain group or other official channels. After the official investigation results are announced, Participants cannot raise objections. But if new and more accurate evidence arises with substantial objections to the original decision, the Official Organization may consider reopening the complaint.\nActions that follow in-game match and Tournament Rules, such as character selection, map use, and kill methods, will not be accepted for complaints.\n\n<B>Code of Conduct for Participants</>\nThe Tournament aims to provide an exciting competitive experience for all Participants yearning for victory. The Official Organization strives to create a fair environment for all Participants, ensuring the value of each match. To create a fair gaming environment, we insist there should be no cheating, system abuse, harassment, or other actions that prevent Participants from performing to the best of their abilities.\nParticipants should address conflicts with mutual respect, avoiding physical/mental violence, threats, or intimidation. Violence against other Participants, fans, judges, official staff, or anyone else is strictly forbidden at all times.\nThe following actions will be considered violations, and the Official Organization has the right to impose penalties such as verbal warnings, rematches, disqualifications from matches/rounds, or forfeitures of prizes/rewards if the actions disrupt the fairness of the game or are deemed inappropriate:\n1.\tFailing to use the designated device to compete;\n2.\tPassive gameplay or illegally obtaining confidential information from other Clash Factions (including but not limited to screen information, internal voices, internal chats, or tactical secrets);\n3.\tUsing any game bugs to gain an advantage, unless explicitly allowed by the Official Organization (Participants are obligated to promptly report any bugs encountered during the Tournament and avoid using them);\n4.\tColluding, fixing matches, or committing acts that severely affect other Participants;\n5.\tMaking inappropriate remarks, spamming excessively, or disrupting the Tournament or livestream in the Tournament area, livestreams, group chats, or in-game chats;\n6.\tModifying the game client in any way;\n7.\tUsing cheat devices and/or programs, or any similar cheating methods (signal devices, macro commands, emulators, XIM, etc.);\n8.\tUsing another Participant's account, or hiring/encouraging/guiding others to use another Participant's account to compete;\n9.\tThreatening, insulting, attacking, bribing, provoking, harassing, or defaming staff of the Official Organization or other Participants;\n10.\tPosting discriminatory or offensive comments about gender, race, religion, political views, financial status, etc. in any form in the Tournament area, livestreams, group chats, or in-game chats;\n11.\tInciting or promoting hate/discrimination in any form in the Tournament area, livestreams, group chats, or in-game chats;\n12.\tEngaging in behavior that violates the User Agreement, Privacy Policy, or any applicable community guidelines/rules.\n\n<B>Rule Changes & Improvements</>\nTo ensure fairness and integrity in the Tournament, the Official Organization reserves the right to revise, amend, or supplement these Rules as needed.\nFor major changes, the Official Organization will notify Participants before the next event or match where the new rules apply. By participating in subsequent events or matches, Participants are deemed to have accepted the revised rules.\nThe officially published rules shall prevail in case of any inconsistency with official communications.\nThe Official Organization has the right to take any necessary measures without restriction to protect the interests of Marvel Rivals, its affiliates, individuals or entities providing products or services for the Tournament, individuals or entities authorized to create and/or release media content during the Tournament, and individuals attending Tournament-related events. All decisions made by the Official Organization are final.\nThe Official Organization reserves the right to interpret all provisions of these Rules and to determine penalties for violations.\n\n<B>Prizes</>\nThe Tournament is the Open Qualifiers for the group stage of Marvel Rivals Ignite Stage 2. The Tournament doesn’t contain any prize pool.\nNote: Marvel/Disney is neither a sponsor of this Tournament nor the provider of the prizes.\n\n<B>Virtual Rewards</>\nThe Tournament offers virtual prizes within the Marvel Rivals game. Based on the final rankings achieved by each participating Clash Faction, the members of that Faction and the Faction itself will receive various types of virtual prizes. The final design and names of the prizes will be determined by how they appear in the game. Participants can check the \"Rewards Preview\" on the Tournament page within the game for timely updates.\nVirtual prizes are divided into two categories: personal prizes and Clash Faction prizes. Personal virtual prizes must be claimed by the corresponding players on the Tournament page. Rewards from previous seasons that were not claimed can be collected on the Marvel Rivals Clash page under the \"Past Tournaments\" tab. These rewards have no expiration date and are unaffected by actions such as leaving or changing Clash Factions. Unclaimed rewards will remain available for the entirety of the game's existence. Please note that some virtual prizes may only be available for a limited time. Regardless of whether players claim them promptly, these prizes will only be usable during the next season of the Tournament they were won in, and will not be available for longer if claimed later.\nClash Faction virtual rewards will be automatically distributed on the Clash Faction page at the end of the season of the corresponding Tournament, and do not need to be manually claimed. Please note, if a Clash Faction is disbanded, all previous honors and related virtual rewards will be permanently lost, and the Organizer will not restore or transfer these rewards to another Clash Faction.\nVirtual prizes are non-transferable and cannot be exchanged for other prizes. The Organizer also reserves the right to redesign, visually optimize, or make other adjustments to virtual prizes that have already been issued or are yet to be issued, without giving prior notice. The Organizer only guarantees the validity of virtual prizes during the operational period of Marvel Rivals.\n\n<B>Tournament Material Use Agreement</>\nThe Official Organization may use all or part of the game footage recorded during the Tournament as original content for official promotions or broadcasts.

For details, please refer to the \"Registration Rules\" section.\nDifferent categories of specific Tournaments in Marvel Rivals Clash use independent Clash Factions. The data between these Clash Factions, and between the Clash Factions and regular Clash Faction, is not shared. The multiple Tournaments in this PlayStation Cup are of the same category and use the same Clash Factions.\n\n<B>Platform</>\nThis Tournament is exclusively for participants playing on PlayStation®5  consoles, covering three regions: the Americas; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; and the Pacific. The Tournaments in each region shall be independent of each other.\nParticipants in this Tournament must adhere to the PlayStation® Network (“PSN”) Terms of Service and participate with a valid PSN account.\nThis Tournament does not support cross-platform participation, and players from different platforms cannot join the same competitive Clash Faction.\n\n<B>Livestreams</>\nParticipants are permitted to livestream their gameplay during the Tournament.\nParticipants must not make any illegal, disrespectful, or inappropriate remarks about other players or Participants while livestreaming.\nParticipants who choose to livestream their matches should set an appropriate delay to prevent their opponents from \"stream sniping\".

The Organizer will continuously monitor and disqualify any Participants who violate this rule.\nThe Organizer may require Participants suspected of violating the above device usage rules to record their gameplay and hand movements during subsequent matches. These recorded files must be submitted for official review within 6 hours after the end of each round and before the start of the next round, using a method specified by the Organizer. Participants who refuse this request may be regarded by the Organizer as violating the device usage rules or engaging in the use of cheats or cheating software. In this case, the Organizer will have the authority to decide on the appropriate action to be taken against the Participant. The screen recording process should clearly include the monitor (if multiple monitors are used, the recording should clearly capture all monitors), the controller, a clear view of the Participant's hands, and the operations on the devices. If the recording process violates one or more of the above requirements, it may be deemed non-compliant by the Organizer. The Organizer's actions may include but are not limited to, verbal warnings, disqualifications from the current match, disqualifications from the current round, removal from the Clash Faction roster, temporary suspensions, permanent bans, or disqualifications of the Clash Faction from the Tournament and from receiving any awards.\n\n<B>Regions</>\nThe Tournament will take place in the following 3 regions, which will operate independently in terms of the schedule. A single Clash Faction can only choose one region to participate in for each Tournament:\n1.\tAmericas PlayStation Cup\n2.\tEurope, Middle East, and Africa PlayStation Cup\n3.\tPacific PlayStation Cup\nIn the Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and Pacific regions, players from any region can register for the Tournament in any region. However, choosing a region that is farther from the player's geographical location may result in higher latency during matches.\nEach player with a single valid identification document can only participate in one Tournament region. It is strictly prohibited for a player to use multiple accounts to participate in the same season's Tournaments in one or more regions. Once discovered, the Committee will remove the player's registration or participation progress in all regions. This includes but is not limited to refusing to award prizes or virtual items, requiring the return of any awarded prizes, reclaiming virtual items, and permanently banning the player from participating in future Marvel Rivals Tournaments.\nThe game platform associated with the account will be determined by the device used by the player when they registered their account. PlayStation players can only form Clash Factions with other PlayStation players and register to participate in Tournaments in any of the regions.\n\n<B>Mirrored Tournament Distribution Rules</>\nThe Tournament features a mirrored tournament distribution system. After the registration deadline for a Tournament region, the system will immediately auto-group all successfully registered Clash Factions, prioritizing the matching of Clash Factions that meet the following criteria:\n1.\tThe server nodes of the Clash Faction captains must be close to each other.\n2.\tThe average rank of the Clash Factions must be similar.\n3.\tClash Factions registering for the same Tournament region cannot be grouped across regions.\nAccording to the above rules, Clash Factions will be divided into sub-tournaments with 8 Factions per group. These sub-tournaments will operate independently in terms of schedule and rewards.\nTo ensure the smooth progression of the Tournament, the grouping results of this Tournament's grouping system may involve the following situations:\n1.\tLatency or rank differences not fully matched.\n2.\tFewer than 8 initial Factions in a sub-tournament group.\nThe Organizer retains the final rights of interpretation for the grouping rules and will not accept requests to change the sub-tournament groupings of the competing Clash Factions.\n\n<B>Registration Rules</>\nThe Organizer shall not require Participants to provide identification documents or any other form of personal information to participate in the Tournament. However, if a Participant is being investigated for violating the aforementioned rules, they may be asked to provide such information.\nThe registration periods for each region in the first 15 editions of the Tournament (from April 2025 to December 2025) are as follows:\n\nPlayStation Cup (Americas; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; Pacific):\nApril:\n1.\tRegistration opens: April 12, 2025, at 12:00 (UTC+0)\n2.\tRegistration closes: April 26, 2025, at 00:00 (UTC+0)\nMay:\n1.\tRegistration opens: May 1, 2025, at 12:00 (UTC+0)\n2.\tRegistration closes: May 31, 2025, at 00:00 (UTC+0)\nJune:\n1.\tRegistration opens: June 1, 2025, at 12:00 (UTC+0)\n2.\tRegistration closes: June 28, 2025, at 00:00 (UTC+0)\nJuly – First half:\n1.\tRegistration opens: July 1, 2025, at 12:00 (UTC+0)\n2.\tRegistration closes: July 12, 2025, at 00:00 (UTC+0)\nJuly – Second half:\n1.\tRegistration opens: July 13, 2025, at 12:00 (UTC+0)\n2.\tRegistration closes: July 26, 2025, at 00:00 (UTC+0)\nAugust – First half:\n1.\tRegistration opens: August 1, 2025, at 12:00 (UTC+0)\n2.\tRegistration closes: August 16, 2025, at 00:00 (UTC+0)\nAugust – Second half:\n1.\tRegistration opens: August 17, 2025, at 12:00 (UTC+0)\n2.\tRegistration closes: August 30, 2025, at 00:00 (UTC+0)\nSeptember – First half:\n1.\tRegistration opens: September 1, 2025, at 12:00 (UTC+0)\n2.\tRegistration closes: September 13, 2025, at 00:00 (UTC+0)\nSeptember – Second half:\n1.\tRegistration opens: September 14, 2025, at 12:00 (UTC+0)\n2.\tRegistration closes: September 27, 2025, at 00:00 (UTC+0)\nOctober – First half:\n1.\tRegistration opens: October 1, 2025, at 12:00 (UTC+0)\n2.\tRegistration closes: October 11, 2025, at 00:00 (UTC+0)\nOctober – Second half:\n1.\tRegistration opens: October 12, 2025, at 12:00 (UTC+0)\n2.\tRegistration closes: October 25, 2025, at 00:00 (UTC+0)\nNovember – First half:\n1.\tRegistration opens: November 1, 2025, at 12:00 (UTC+0)\n2.\tRegistration closes: November 15, 2025, at 00:00 (UTC+0)\nNovember – Second half:\n1.\tRegistration opens: November 16, 2025, at 12:00 (UTC+0)\n2.\tRegistration closes: November 29, 2025, at 00:00 (UTC+0)\nDecember – First half:\n1.\tRegistration opens: December 1, 2025, at 12:00 (UTC+0)\n2.\tRegistration closes: December 13, 2025, at 00:00 (UTC+0)\nDecember – Second half:\n1.\tRegistration opens: December 14, 2025, at 12:00 (UTC+0)\n2.\tRegistration closes: December 27, 2025, at 00:00 (UTC+0)\n\nThere are no rank requirements for registration in this Tournament.\nThe maximum number of Clash Factions for registration in each match of this Tournament across all regions is 25,000. The registration limit applies to the total number of Clash Factions across all regions, with no region having a separate registration cap. The official reserves the right to adjust the upper limit of registration numbers in real time based on the registration situation during the registration phase.\nParticipants must register on the \"Tournament\" interface within the game. There are no other registration channels for this Tournament.\nAll players who meet the eligibility requirements to be Participants are welcome to register. The Clash Factions must be formed via the \"Clash Faction\" system on the Tournament interface. Once the captain or coach ensures that all members of the Clash Faction meet the platform and rank requirements for the Tournament, they can initiate the registration process on the Tournament page under the \"Tournament\" section. Once the captain or coach initiates the registration, the other members of the Clash Faction will automatically agree to the registration. After all other members confirm their registration on the Tournament page, the registration will be successfully completed.\nIf any members of the Clash Faction have not confirmed their registration by the registration deadline, the registration will be regarded as unsuccessful.\nDuring the registration confirmation period, the Clash Faction captain can still add or remove members at any time. The registration will be automatically completed once all members have confirmed their participation. If a member is removed or if a member voluntarily leaves the match early, resulting in the Clash Faction having fewer than 6 members, the registration process will be immediately paused and the registration will fail.\nNote: Once the registration is successful and the registration deadline has passed, the Clash Faction will not be able to add, remove, or change members during the Tournament. Please carefully review the members of the Clash Faction before registration. Once the registration is complete, the Organizer will not permit any changes to the members of the Clash Faction. If a registered Clash Faction has over 6 members, they can freely decide which members will participate in each match before it begins. The Organizer recommends that participating Clash Factions configure an appropriate number of substitutes in case of any unforeseen circumstances.\nBefore the registration deadline, each Clash Faction will have two opportunities to cancel its registration. The Clash Faction captain can cancel the registration at any time. If more than half of the Clash Faction's members confirm the cancellation, the registration will be successfully canceled.\nIf a Clash Faction successfully cancels its registration before the deadline, the total number of registered Clash Factions will be reduced accordingly.\nIf the Clash Faction registration limit is reached when all members of the Clash Faction have confirmed their registration, the Clash Faction will not be able to register.\nRegistered Clash Factions must ensure that their name, abbreviation, announcement, and all member names are appropriate, free from any illegal content, and do not infringe on personal rights. Additionally, they should avoid the improper or offensive use of copyrighted material and refrain from including any inappropriate references to gender, race, religion, political views, economic status, or other sensitive topics. Clash Factions that do not comply with the regulations will be forced to change their name or be disqualified, depending on the severity of the violation. In addition, no further notice will be given.\nOnly players aged 16 and above are permitted to participate in the Tournament in all regions. Players who are 16 years old but are still minors by the registration deadline must submit a complete, signed guardian consent form to the Organizer in order to participate (the legal age is determined according to the laws of the Participant's country of nationality), with the deadline being the official registration cutoff time. All Clash Faction captains, coaches, and members must meet the required age for participation. Please note that Clash Factions containing players who do not meet the age requirements will be disqualified from the Tournament and will forfeit their eligibility for prizes and/or in-game awards. The captain is responsible for verifying the real age of each member and ensuring that all members meet the age requirements to participate in the Tournament.\n\n<B>Ban-Lock Process</>\nAll matches in the Tournament will involve a captain's ban process. The specific process is as follows:\n1.\tSide A bans one hero\n2.\tSide B bans one hero\n3.\tSide B locks in one hero\n4.\tSide A locks in one hero\n5.\tSide A bans one hero\n6.\tSide B bans one hero\n7.\tSide B locks in one hero\n8.\tSide A locks in one hero\n9.\tSide A bans one hero\n10.\tSide B bans one hero\nHeroes that have been locked in cannot be banned in the subsequent banning phases.\nBoth the banning and locking-in phases can be skipped if no action is taken. The corresponding phase will be skipped once the countdown ends.\nAfter the banning phase ends, up to 6 heroes will be banned from the match. Participants from both sides can then select heroes from those that have not been banned.\nAny errors during hero banning, incorrect lock-in selections, or skipped phases due to issues caused by the Clash Faction itself (such as operational mistakes or skipping due to the countdown ending) will not be handled by the Organizer. The match will proceed as scheduled, and the consequences will be the responsibility of the Clash Faction itself.\nIn BO1 matches, the system will randomly assign one side to ban heroes first.\nIn BO3 or larger matches, the system will randomly assign one side to ban first in the first match, and for subsequent matches, the winner of the previous match will be the side that bans first.\nThe \"leader\" responsible for bans will select from the players participating in the match in the following order:\n1.\tClash Factions Captain\n2.\tClash Factions Coach\n3.\tThe player who is in the first position in the preparation lobby\n4.\tRandomly decided\nDuring the ban and pick process, if the designated \"leader\" disconnects, the system will randomly select another player from the participating team to become the new \"leader\" responsible for banning. Therefore, all players are advised to pay attention during this process. Please note that if the original \"leader\" responsible for banning successfully reconnects, they will not become responsible for banning again. The new designated player will continue to carry out the banning process instead.\n\n<B>Map Selection Rules</>\nThe maps available in the Tournament will be all the playable maps included in Competitive mode at the start of the game season. Maps added to Competitive mode during the season will not be included in the available map list for the Tournament's matches.\nIn single elimination stages, for the first match of a round, the map and initial side selection will be randomly determined by the system. Starting from the second match, if the selected map has attack-defense features (such as Convergence or Convoy mode maps), the losing side of the previous match will take the attacking role first.\nThe system will randomly prioritize a map that is different from the previous match for the second and subsequent matches within a round.\n\n<B>Single Elimination Stage Rules</>\nOnce the mirrored Tournament brackets are finalized, each sub-tournament will feature a single elimination stage, starting with 8 Factions.\nIn some sub-tournaments where the starting number of Factions is fewer than 8, the corresponding slots will be given a bye.\nEach single elimination stage will consist of three stages: quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. There will be no third-place match in this Tournament.\nThe three stages of the single elimination stage for each Tournament will take place on the last Saturday of each calendar month. Please refer to the schedule outlined in this section for more details.\nThe matchups for the first round of the single elimination stage will be randomly generated.\nAfter a match starts, Clash Factions must promptly check the \"Tournament\" page for match schedules and the latest start times for each round of the knockout stage.\nThe latest start times for each round of the single elimination stage in each region are as follows. Any matches that have not started will automatically begin at these times.\n\nAmericas PlayStation Cup:\nApril:\n1.\tQuarterfinals: April 26, 2025, at 14:00 (UTC-4)\n2.\tSemifinals: April 26, 2025, at

single elimination stage is announced, participating Clash Factions can arrange their match times freely as long as they start before the \"latest start time\" designated by the system. It is recommended that both sides agree on an earlier match time. When any 6 members from both participating Clash Factions are ready in the Tournament's pre-match lobby, the system will automatically start the countdown and begin the match early. Please note that multiple matches in a single round will be played consecutively.\nOnce the match begins, all games within a knockout stage (i.e., a BO3, BO5, or BO7) will be played consecutively without any long pauses in between. Participating Clash Factions will have up to 15 minutes of break time between matches. Once the break ends, the system will automatically force the next match to start. During the break, if all 12 members of both Clash Factions are ready in advance, the next match can start early.\nNote: If the participating Clash Factions do not start the match before the \"latest start time\" of each round, the system will automatically force the match to start. If a Clash Faction has fewer than 6 members at that time, the system will automatically award victory to the opposing Clash Faction, advancing them to the next round. If both participating Clash Factions have fewer than 6 members, the system will randomly select a winner to advance to the next round.\nNote: Whether a match starts early or is forced to start by the system, all games in the BO3, BO5, and BO7 knockout stages will be played consecutively, with a 15-minute break between each match.\nIn the second and subsequent matches of a single elimination stage, when the system's forced automatic start time is reached, if one side's Clash Faction has fewer than 6 players, the system will automatically declare the opposing Clash Faction the winner of the entire round and advance them to the next stage (this applies to the result of the entire round, not just the single match). If both sides have fewer than 6 members, the system will randomly select one side as the winner and advance them to the next stage (this applies to the result of the entire round, not just a single match).\nIn a single elimination stage, a \"bye\" situation may occur (where a Clash Faction automatically advances to the next round without playing a match). If one side has a bye, the other side will automatically advance to the next stage. If both sides have a bye, no Clash Factions in that bracket will advance.\nBefore each round of the single elimination stage and during the breaks between multiple matches in each round, Clash Factions may freely adjust the members in their lobby. However, the \"latest start time\" must always be paid attention to. If, at that time, one of the participating Clash Factions has fewer than 6 members in the game lobby, that Clash Faction will be eliminated, and the opposing Clash Faction will advance.\nThe team captain and coach of a participating Clash Faction are not required to be in the knockout stage preparation lobby. As long as there are 6 participating Clash Faction members in the lobby, the match can begin.\nAll matches will follow a BO3 format.\n\n<B>Tournament Guide</>\nThe match results and data will primarily be automatically determined by the Tournament system. If any major disputes arise, the Organizer's decision will prevail.\nThis Tournament will use the latest game version at the time of each match. The game version may be updated during the Tournament.\nParticipants will be responsible for preparing their own devices and resolving any network issues. It is recommended to use a stable wired connection. Participants should test their network in advance. If any network or device issues occur during online matches, Participants will be responsible for the consequences.\nParticipants must cooperate with the Organizer for device and network IP address checks.\nParticipating Clash Factions may replace players within the registered roster before and between matches, but temporary substitutes are not permitted. During the latest start time in the knockout stage, if a participating Clash Faction has fewer than 6 members in the preparation lobby, it will be regarded as that round being forfeited. If both participating Clash Factions have fewer than 6 members in the preparation lobby, the system will automatically determine which Clash Faction advances. Matches initiated by the system include two situations:\n1.\tThe match has reached the latest start time, but the participating Clash Faction has not started the match.\n2.\tIn knockout stages, there will be designated breaks between all of the BO3, BO5, and BO7 format matches. If the participating Clash Faction has not started the next match by the end of the break, the system will force the match to begin.\n\n<B>Error Handling</>\nIn this Tournament, no stages can be paused or replayed. Participants are responsible for managing their own network connection and ensuring its stability. In the event of a disconnection, players can use the \"Reconnect\" feature to quickly return to the game. This feature is not exclusive to the Tournament, and the Organizer does not guarantee its effectiveness or stability. The Organizer is not responsible for any failed reconnections. The Organizer will not accept complaints related to disconnections caused by network issues. Using game boosters or other software to speed up, change nodes, or disconnect may result in network instability, disconnections, or failure to reconnect. The Organizer will not be held responsible for any consequences arising from the use of such software.\nIn rare circumstances, if the game server fails to record match results, the Tournament system will automatically take the following measures: During single elimination stages, the unrecorded match results will be disregarded, and the scores for both sides will remain unchanged. However, the system will still automatically proceed with the rest period between matches and the next match, until the results for the BO3, BO5, or BO7 matches are confirmed. Participating Clash Factions are advised to pay attention to notifications from the Tournament system and participate in matches promptly.\nThis Tournament will be managed by the in-game system for match scheduling and result determination. The results of the registration phase and the single elimination phase will be based on the data automatically generated by the Tournament system. Since this Tournament is an entertainment competition aimed at a large player base and has no registration requirements, in the event of a major interruption, the Organizer will not manually organize a rematch or take other such actions. If the Tournament progress cannot be permanently restored or if rewards cannot be recovered, the Organizer will not arrange rematches or redistribute rewards. Please be aware.\n\n<B>Dispute/Complaint Rules</>\nThe Organizer is the highest authority for this Tournament. For any major disputes that occur during the Tournament, the Participants involved must submit evidence. If the next match has already begun, or if more than 6 hours have passed since the match ended, the Organizer will no longer accept any appeals regarding that match.\nThe complainant must be a member of the participating Clash Faction, and the relevant player must provide evidence in a timely manner.\nThe standard procedure for disputes/complaints is as follows: The relevant player collects evidence and submits it to the Organizer via the in-game reporting channel or official channels. The Organizer will then conduct an investigation and announce the results.\nOnce the complaint is accepted, the Organizer will immediately start an investigation that adheres to the principles of transparency, fairness, and justice, and will collect, analyze, and review all evidence. All Participants are obligated to submit truthful evidence. If a Participant conceals information or misleads the Organizer to obstruct an investigation, that Participant and their Clash Faction will be punished.\nThe Organizer will make a ruling based on the facts and the rules. The decision will be publicly announced through official channels. Once the result of the Organizer's investigation is announced, Participants may not dispute the result. However, if new, accurate evidence emerges and there are substantial objections to the new ruling, the Organizer may consider reopening the investigation.\nIn-game behavior that complies with the game rules and Tournament Rules, such as character selection, map utilization, and kill methods, may not be disputed.\n\n<B>Code of Conduct for Participants</>\nThis Tournament aims to provide all Participants who strive for victory with an exciting competitive experience. The Organizer is committed to providing all Participants with a fair competitive environment to ensure the value of every match. Our philosophy is that in a fair gaming environment, there should be no cheating, abuse of the game system, harassment, or any behavior that prevents Participants from performing to the best of their abilities.\nParticipants should resolve differences in a respectful manner, avoiding the use of violence, threats, or intimidation, regardless of whether the behavior is carried out in person. The use of violence against anyone, including other Participants, fans, referees, and the Organizer's staff, is strictly prohibited at all times.\nThe following behaviors will be regarded as violations, and the Organizer has the right to impose penalties for such behaviors, such as warnings, rematches, match forfeits, round forfeits, or the confiscation of prizes or rewards for any actions that affect the fairness of the Tournament or are deemed uncivilized:\n1.\tNot using the designated devices as required by the Tournament;\n2.\tThrowing matches, illegally obtaining confidential information from other participating Clash Factions (including but not limited to screen information, internal voice chats, internal messages, tactical information, etc.);\n3.\tIntentionally exploiting any in-game glitches for an advantage unless it is explicitly allowed by the Organizer. Participants have the obligation to report any in-game glitches they encounter in the Tournament and actively avoid exploiting them;\n4.\tMatch-fixing, giving away matches, or engaging in behaviors that severely affect the interests of other Participants;\n5.\tPosting inappropriate comments or spamming comments in the matches, Tournament livestreams, Tournament groups, or in-game chats that disrupt the normal flow of the Tournament or livestreams;\n6.\tModifying the game client in any way;\n7.\tUsing any type of cheating devices and/or cheating programs, or any similar cheating methods (e.g., signal devices, macro commands for keyboard/mouse, emulators, XIM products, etc.);\n8.\tPlaying matches with other Participants' accounts or hiring, inciting, or guiding others to use other Participants' accounts (smurfing);\n9.\tThreatening, insulting, attacking, bribing, provoking, harassing, or defaming the Organizer's staff or other Participants;\n10.\tPosting inappropriate comments related to gender, race, religion, political stance, financial status, etc., in matches, Tournament livestreams, Tournament groups, or any form of in-game chat;\n11.\tInciting or promoting hate or discrimination against others in matches, Tournament livestreams, Tournament groups, or any form of in-game chat;\n12.\tConducting behavior that violates the User Agreement and Privacy Policy or any applicable community guidelines or rules.\n\n<B>Rule Changes and Improvements</>\nTo maintain the fairness and integrity of the Tournament, the Organizer reserves the right to revise, modify, or supplement these rules at any time based on the circumstances.\nIf any significant changes are made to these rules, the Organizer will notify Participants before the start of the next Tournament or match about implementing the new rules. Participating in subsequent Tournaments or matches will be regarded as accepting the changed rules.\nIn the event of any conflict between communications with the Organizer and the officially published rules, the officially published rules shall prevail.\nThe Organizer has the right to take all necessary measures, without any restrictions, to protect the interests of Marvel Rivals, and any individuals or entities related to Marvel Rivals or the Organizer, including those providing products or services for the Tournament, individuals or entities authorized to produce and/or release media content during the Tournament, as well as individuals attending Tournament-related activities. All decisions made by the Organizer shall be final.\nThe Organizer reserves the right to interpret all clauses of these Rules and make decisions regarding penalties for any violations.\n\n<B>Virtual Prizes</>\nThis Tournament offers virtual prizes within the Marvel Rivals game. Based on the final rankings achieved by each participating Clash Faction, the members of that Faction and the Faction itself will receive various types of virtual prizes. The final design and names of the prizes will be determined by how they appear in the game. Participants can check the \"Rewards Preview\" on the Tournament page within the game for timely updates.\nPlease be advised that in order to qualify for tournament rewards, your participating clash faction must complete at least one tournament match. This condition can be satisfied in one of two ways: by either completing one tournament match in a normal manner or by having all six participating players present and advancing to the next round by way of a bye. Should the aforementioned conditions not be met, your team will be ineligible to receive any virtual items or monetary rewards, regardless of your team's final ranking.\nVirtual prizes are divided into two categories: personal prizes and Clash Faction prizes. Personal virtual prizes must be claimed by the corresponding players on the Tournament page. Rewards from previous seasons that were not claimed can be collected on the Marvel Rivals Clash page under the \"Past Tournaments\" tab. These rewards have no expiration date and are unaffected by actions such as leaving or changing Clash Factions. Unclaimed rewards will remain available for the entirety of the game's existence. Please note that some virtual prizes may only be available for a limited time. Regardless of whether players claim them promptly, these prizes will only be usable during the next season of the Tournament they were won in, and will not be available for longer if claimed later.\nClash Faction virtual rewards will be automatically distributed on the Clash Faction page at the end of the season of the corresponding Tournament, and do not need to be manually claimed. Please note, if a Clash Faction is disbanded, all previous honors and related virtual rewards will be permanently lost, and the Organizer will not restore or transfer these rewards to another Clash Faction.\nVirtual prizes are non-transferable and cannot be exchanged for other prizes. The Organizer also reserves the right to redesign, visually optimize, or make other adjustments to virtual prizes that have already been issued or are yet to be issued, without giving prior notice. The Organizer only guarantees the validity of virtual prizes during the operational period of Marvel Rivals.\n\n<B>Game Footage Terms of Use</>\nThe Organizer or SIE may use all or some of the game footage recorded during the Tournament as original content for official promotions or broadcasts. This footage may include the names of Participants, in-game names, Clash Faction names, Clash Faction abbreviations, and full gameplay footage. Please note that by successfully registering for the Tournament, Participants agree to the following terms:\nI hereby grant NetEase, SIE, Marvel, Disney, their affiliates, and permitted third parties absolute and irrevocable rights and licenses to use and adapt my in-game name, logo, character, gameplay footage, game data, and any livestreaming content created during my participation in this game or any other game, and to create derivative works based on this content.

The Participant hereby waives any right to file a lawsuit or seek injunctions or other equitable remedies against the Indemnitees in connection with this Tournament or its production, distribution, display, advertising, promotion, or publicity.\nUnder these Tournament Rules, the Indemnitees shall not be held liable for any consequential, incidental, indirect, punitive, special, or exemplary damages, whether arising from a Participant or any individual or entity claiming rights through a Participant. This includes, but is not limited to, losses of data, revenue, prizes, or profits resulting from breach of contract, negligence, or any other legal theory, whether or not such damages were foreseeable, or whether the Organizer, Marvel, Disney, or any affiliates or representatives were made aware of the potential for such damages to occur.\nEach Participant acknowledges the inherent risks, dangers, and hazards associated with the Tournament and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, voluntarily accepts and assumes all such risks, including the potential for personal injury, death, property damage, or loss arising from participation in these activities.\nThe Participant acknowledges and agrees that NetEase, SIE, Marvel, and Disney are not insurers of the Participant's property or personal safety. If a Participant believes they need insurance, they should obtain coverage from a third party on their own.\n\n<B>Disclaimer</>\nThis Tournament is one of the Organizer's online events.

至2025年8月10日举行。\n中国大陆赛区的海选赛匹配时间段如下：\n\n中国大陆PC赛区：\n1.\t2025年8月9日 19:00至 23:00 (UTC+8)；\n2.\t2025年8月10日 至 23:00

(UTC+8)\n\n每轮双败淘汰赛的对阵表全部公布后，战队可在系统指示的“最晚开始时间”之前自行安排比赛时间。建议交战双方商定相对早的比赛时间。当双方的6名任意战队成员都在双败淘汰赛备战房间提前准备就绪时，系统将自动开始倒计时并提前开始比赛。请注意，一轮中的多场比赛将连续进行。\n比赛开始后，每轮淘汰赛（即一个BO3、BO5、BO7）中的所有比赛都将连续进行，不会有任何长时间的暂停。战队在各场比赛间将有15分钟的休息时间，休息时间结束后，系统将强制自动开始下一场比赛。休息期间，战队双方12名成员亦可提前悉数准备并提前开始下一场比赛。\n请注意：如果战队未在每轮“最晚开始时间”之前主动开始比赛，系统届时将自动强制开始比赛。若此时一方战队人数不足6人，系统将自动判定对方战队胜出并晋级。若双方战队均人数不足，系统将随机选择胜者晋级。\n请注意：无论比赛是提前开始还是由系统强制启动，BO3、BO5和BO7的所有比赛都将连续进行，并在各场比赛间提供15分钟的休息时间。\n在一轮双败淘汰赛中的第2场及后续场次的系统强制自动开赛时间到达时，若一方战队人数不足6人，系统将自动判定对方战队获胜并晋级（非仅判定单场胜负，而是整轮比赛的胜负）。若双方均人数不足，系统将随机选择一方获胜并晋级（非仅判定单场胜负，而是整轮比赛的胜负）。\n双败淘汰赛阶段可能出现轮空情况。一方轮空时，对方自动晋级。双方均轮空时，此分支没有晋级战队。\n每轮双败淘汰赛前及每轮中的多场比赛间休息时，战队可自由调整房间内的参赛成员。但须时刻注意“最晚开始时间”。若届时游戏房间内一方战队人数不足6人，该战队将被直接淘汰，对方战队晋级。\n战队的队长和教练均可以不在双败淘汰赛备战房间内。只要房间内有6名参赛战队成员，即可开始比赛。\n启动轮至第9轮采用BO3赛制，第10轮至第14轮采用BO5赛制，败者组决赛采用BO5赛制，决赛采用BO7赛制。\n\n<B>赛事指南</>\n比赛结果和数据将主要由赛事系统自动判定。如遇重大争议，则以官方决定为准。\n本赛事使用每场比赛当时的最新游戏版本，在赛事过程中，游戏版本可能更新。\n参赛选手请自行准备设备并解决网络问题。建议使用稳定的有线网络。参赛选手应事先调试好网络，线上比赛如个人出现网络问题或设备问题，后果将由选手自行承担。\n参赛选手有义务配合官方进行设备和网络IP地址检查。\n战队可以在赛前和比赛场间在战队已报名的参赛选手范围内替换选手，不可以使用临时替补。在淘汰赛阶段的最晚开赛时间，如果一支战队在进入端内比赛备战房间的人数少于6人，将被视为该轮弃权。如果双方战队进入比赛备战房间的人数均少于6人，系统将自动决定晋级方。系统自动开始的比赛包括两种情况：\n1.\t已到最晚开赛时间，但战队未主动开始的比赛；\n2.\t淘汰赛的BO3、BO5以及BO7的每场之间会有指定的休息时间，如果战队在休息时间截止时仍未开始下一场比赛，系统将强制开始；\n进入双败淘汰赛阶段后，战队队长必须加入官方在指定的平台建立的队长群，以及时了解最新的赛事信息并在比赛期间就任何争议或问题进行及时沟通。\n\n<B>异常处理</>\n在本赛事中，海选赛、复选赛和双败淘汰赛阶段均不可暂停或重赛。参赛选手应自行管理网络连接并确保其稳定。如遇断线，玩家可使用“重新连接”功能快速返回游戏，该功能非赛事专属，官方不保证其有效性和稳定性，对重连失败不承担责任。官方不受理因网络问题导致断线的投诉。使用加速器等软件进行加速、更换节点或断开连接均可能造成网络连接不稳定、断线或无法重连等后果，官方不对此类行为造成的后果承担责任。\n在极少数情况下，如因游戏服务器问题导致无法记录比赛结果，赛事系统将自动采取以下措施：对于海选赛和复选赛，比赛场次计数不增加，积分不变，受影响的战队可在赛事匹配时间段内继续进行比赛。在双败淘汰赛阶段，未记录的比赛结果将忽略不计，双方比分不变，但系统仍会自动进行场间休息和下一场比赛，直到确定BO3、BO5或BO7的轮次比赛结果，请参赛战队对赛事系统通知保持关注，及时参与比赛。\n本赛事由端内系统进行比赛安排和结果判定。报名阶段、海选赛、复选赛和双败淘汰赛阶段的结果都将以赛事系统全自动生成的数据为准。如遇重大中断，官方有权切换到手动操作模式，通过自定义房间和队长群协调组织剩余赛程。如需进行此变动，官方将在队长群中及时通知。一旦进入手动操作模式，所有比赛结果将由官方宣布。\n\n<B>异议/投诉规则</>\n官方是本次赛事的最高权威机构。对于赛事期间发生的任何重大争议，涉事参赛选手须提交证据。如下一轮比赛已开始，或者距离比赛结束超过6个小时，官方将不再受理对该场比赛的任何申诉。\n投诉人必须是参赛战队的成员，且相关参赛选手须及时提供证据佐证。\n异议/投诉的标准程序如下：相关参赛选手保留证据，并通过队长群公开表达或其他官方渠道提交给官方。随后，官方将进行调查并公布结果。\n仲裁一旦受理，官方将本着公开、公平和公正的原则立即展开调查并收集、分析和审查证据。所有参赛选手都有义务如实报告。如参赛选手隐瞒信息或误导官方以阻碍调查，则该参赛选手及其战队将受到处罚。\n官方将根据事实和规则的宗旨做出裁决。裁决结果将在队长群或其他官方渠道公开宣布。官方调查结果公布后，参赛选手不得对结果提出异议。但如出现新的、准确的证据，并且对新的裁决仍有实质性异议，官方可以考虑重新仲裁。\n比赛中符合游戏内对局规则和赛事规则的行为，如角色选取、地图利用、击杀方式等异议，均不在投诉与受理范围内。\n\n<B>选手行为准则</>\n本赛事旨在为所有力争胜利的参赛选手提供激动人心的竞技体验。官方致力于为所有参赛选手提供公平的竞技环境，以充分确保每场比赛的价值。我们的理念是在一个公平的游戏环境中，不应存在作弊、滥用游戏系统、骚扰和妨碍任何参赛选手发挥最佳水平的行为。\n参赛选手应以彼此尊重的方式解决分歧，避免诉诸暴力、威胁或恐吓，无论前述行为是否涉及肢体接触。无论何时，严禁对任何人使用暴力，包括其他参赛选手、粉丝、裁判和官方人员。\n以下行为将被视为违规行为，官方有权对影响赛事公平性或被认定为不文明的行为做出如口头警告、重赛、本场判负、本轮判负、没收奖金奖品等裁决：\n1.\t未按照赛事要求使用指定设备进行比赛；\n2.\t消极比赛，非法获得其他战队的保密信息（包括但不限于屏幕信息、内部语音、内部聊天、战术保密内容等）；\n3.\t除官方明确允许外，故意利用任何游戏内的漏洞以获取优势；参赛选手有义务及时报告在赛事中遇到的任何游戏漏洞，并主动避免利用这些漏洞；\n4.\t串通比赛、假赛，或进行严重影响其他参赛选手利益的行为；\n5.\t在比赛区域、赛事直播、赛事群或局内聊天中发表不当言论、过度刷屏，或采取影响赛事或直播正常推进的行为；\n6.\t对游戏客户端做出任何修改；\n7.\t使用任何种类的作弊设备及/或作弊程序，或者任何类似的作弊手段（例如信号装置、键鼠宏命令、模拟器、XIM等）；\n8.\t使用其他参赛选手的账号比赛或者雇佣、教唆、怂恿或引导其他人使用其他参赛选手的账号进行游戏（代打）；\n9.\t威胁、辱骂、攻击、贿赂、挑衅、骚扰或诽谤官方成员或其他参赛选手的行为；\n10.\t在比赛区域、赛事直播、赛事群或端内任何形式的聊天中发表任何有关性别、种族、宗教、政治立场、财务状况等不恰当的针对性言论；\n11.\t在比赛区域、赛事直播、赛事群或端内任何形式的聊天中煽动或宣传针对他人的仇恨或歧视；\n12.\t参与违反《用户协议与隐私政策》或适用的社区指南或规则的行为。\n\n<B>规则变更与改进</>\n为确保比赛的公平公正和赛事的完整性，官方有权随时根据实际情况修订、修改或补充本规则。\n若本规则发生重大变更，官方将在下一场实施新规则的赛事活动或比赛开始前通知参赛选手。参与后续活动或比赛即视为接受修改后的规则。\n如与官方沟通的内容和正式发布的规则之间存在冲突，以正式发布的规则为准。\n官方有权在不受任何限制的情况下采取一切必要措施，以维护《漫威争锋》、与《漫威争锋》或官方相关的并包括为赛事提供产品或服务的任何个人或实体、被授权在赛事期间制作和/或发布媒体内容的个人或实体，以及出席赛事相关活动的个人的利益。官方做出的所有决定均为最终决定。\n官方保留对本规则所有条款的解释权，以及对违规行为做出处罚的决定权。\n\n<B>奖金</>\n本赛事设有专门的奖金池，“奖金设置”中列出的所有奖金均为税前数额。\n实际领奖人知悉奖金相关税费由本人自行承担。实际领奖人同意官方支付相关奖金时，依法预扣预缴个人所得税，及代为申报其他相关税费（如有），并在结算金额中扣除上述相关税费。若实际领奖人在办理个人所得税汇算清缴时涉及补税的，需补缴税款由实际领奖人自行承担，与官方无关。\n赛事结束后，官方将联系获奖战队安排奖金发放事宜。获奖者须按照官方规定的流程，签署奖金领取书。\n官方有权取消多次参与同一赛事参赛选手的参赛资格，亦有权拒绝向包含违规参赛选手的获胜战队颁发奖金。\n若参赛选手间无特别书面约定，奖金将平均分配给赛事报名截止时，参赛战队名单上列出的所有成员，无论该成员是否参与了比赛对局。\n奖品不可转让或用于兑换其他奖品。如无法提供某项奖品，官方有权自行决定替换为同等或更高价值的奖品。除非官方允许采用其他支付方式，否则在中国大陆PC赛区的赛事中，所有现金奖励将以人民币支付，在其他所有赛区的赛事中，所有现金奖励将以美元支付。有资格获得奖品的潜在获奖者应承担奖品使用的所有责任。\n请注意，若你的战队在淘汰赛阶段全程，未完成至少一场比赛，则你的战队无法获得战队奖励，战队成员也无法获得任何虚拟奖励、现金奖励或实物奖励。正常进行一场淘汰赛比赛，或以6人满编在备战房间中，由于对手未完整出席而触发自动晋级，均算作有效参与。\n请注意，漫威/迪士尼并非本赛事的赞助商，也非奖品提供方。\n\n<B>奖金设置</>\n中国大陆PC赛区

20:00 (UTC+8)；\n2.\t第一轮截止报名：2025年8月14日 18:00 (UTC+8)；\n3.\t第二轮开启报名：2025年8月18日 0:00 (UTC+8)；\n4.\t第二轮截止报名：2025年8月21日 18:00 (UTC+8)；\n\n本赛事报名段位要求是“大师3”。报名时，所有征战战队成员均需在对应游戏赛季中曾经达到过报名要求的竞技模式段位。\n本赛事每轮报名征战战队数量上限：512支/赛区。\n玩家必须通过游戏内的“赛事-漫威争锋征战圆桌”界面完成报名，本赛事无其他报名渠道。\n所有符合参赛选手要求的玩家皆可报名。征战战队必须通过游戏内的“征战战队”系统组建，队长或教练在确保所有征战战队成员符合期望报名赛事的平台和段位要求后，即可在“赛事”端口下的漫威争锋征战圆桌页面发起报名。发起报名后，队长或教练的另一方会自动同意报名，在其他所有征战战队成员分别前往赛事页面主动确认报名后，报名成功。\n在报名截止时间，若仍存在未确认报名的征战战队成员，则会导致征战战队报名失败。\n在报名确认期间，征战战队队长仍然可以随时添加或移除征战战队成员，在所有征战战队成员均为确认报名状态后，报名即自动成功。若移除成员或成员主动退出的操作导致征战战队成员数量小于6名，则报名进程会立即中止，报名失败。\n请注意：报名成功且报名截止后，征战战队在比赛期间无法添加、删除或改变队员。请在报名之前仔细确认征战战队名单，一旦完成报名，官方将不再受理更改征战战队成员的请求。如果报名征战战队拥有超过6名队员，则可在每场比赛开始前自由决定每场比赛的出战名单。官方建议参赛征战战队配置合适数量的替补，以应对突发状况。\n在报名截止时间之前，每支征战战队有两次取消报名的机会。征战战队队长可以随时发起取消报名操作，并在获得过半征战战队成员确认后，成功取消报名。\n在报名截止前若有征战战队成功取消报名，则已报名征战战队数量亦将对应减少。\n若所有征战战队成员完成报名确认一刻，报名征战战队数量已满，你的征战战队将无法完成报名。\n已报名征战战队必须确保其征战战队名称、缩写、征战战队公告和所有成员名称均适当，且不含任何违法内容，不侵犯个人权益，不存在版权内的不当或侮辱性使用，或包含任何关于性别、种族、宗教、政治立场、经济状况等不当引用。不符合规定的征战战队将依据情节严重程度，被强制更名或被取消参赛资格，且不再另行通知。\n本赛事中国大陆赛区仅允许18周岁以上的玩家参与。本赛事其他赛区仅允许16周岁以上的玩家参与，已满16周岁，但在报名截止日前未成年的参赛选手，需要向官方提交完整签字的监护人同意书后方可参赛（成年年龄按照参赛选手所在国籍国家的法律要求为准），以报名截止一刻为准。所有征战战队队长、教练和成员必须达到参赛年龄要求。请注意，包含未满足年龄要求选手的征战战队将被取消参赛资格，并失去获得奖金和/或游戏内奖励的权利。队长有责任核实每位成员的真实年龄，并确保每位成员符合参赛年龄要求。\n本赛事的两轮均禁止已经获得漫威争锋燃系列赛阶段二小组赛资格的战队的所有成员参与。在本赛事第一轮成功获取晋级资格的战队，亦被禁止参与本赛事第二轮。\n\n<B>禁选流程</>\n本赛事的所有场次均设有队长禁选流程，具体流程如下：\n1.\tA方禁用1名英雄；\n2.\tB方禁用1名英雄；\n3.\tB方锁选1名英雄；\n4.\tA方锁选1名英雄；\n5.\tA方禁用1名英雄；\n6.\tB方禁用1名英雄；\n7.\tB方锁选1名英雄；\n8.\tA方锁选1名英雄；\n9.\tA方禁用1名英雄；\n10.\tB方禁用1名英雄；\n锁选的英雄不能在后续禁用流程中被禁用。\n禁用和锁选流程均可以不操作，对应流程将在倒计时结束后跳过。\n禁选流程结束后，至多6名英雄将在本场比赛中被禁用，双方选手可在其他未被禁用的英雄中选择使用。\n因征战战队自身原因（操作失误，倒计时结束跳过等）而导致的英雄错误禁用、错误锁选、流程跳过等，不在官方的受理范围内，比赛将继续进行，后果由征战战队自行承担。\n在BO1对局中，系统将随机指定一边先禁用。\n在BO3或以上规模的对局中，首场比赛将由系统随机指定一边先禁用，后续场次的比赛均由前一场败方先禁用。\n负责禁选的“队长”将按下述顺序，从参与比赛对局的参赛选手中选取：\n1.\t征战战队队长；\n2.\t征战战队教练；\n3.\t备战房间中处在首位的参赛选手；\n4.\t随机决定；\n在禁选过程中，若负责禁选的“队长”掉线，则系统将随机从其他参赛选手中选择一名成为负责禁选的“队长”，因此请所有参赛选手在禁选过程中保持关注。请注意，若原负责禁选的“队长”成功重连，禁选职责也将不再交换，仍然需由新指定的另一名参赛选手继续完成禁选流程。\n\n<B>地图选取规则</>\n本赛事的可用地图池与竞技模式的可用地图池保持实时同步。请注意，每场比赛的可用地图池因此可能发生实时变更。\n在海选赛中，所有场次的地图和初始选边将由系统随机决定。\n在单败淘汰赛中，1轮比赛中的首场比赛，地图和初始选边将由系统随机决定。从第2场比赛开始，若选中的地图带有攻防特征（即融合或巡航模式地图），将由前一场比赛的败方率先担任进攻方。\n系统将为1轮比赛中的第2场及之后场次的比赛优先随机选择与前序场次不同的地图。\n\n<B>海选赛规则</>\n海选赛将于2025年8月14日至8月15日，以及2025年8月21日至8月22日举行。\n各赛区的海选赛匹配时间段如下：\n\n中国大陆赛区-第一轮：\n1.\t2025年8月14日 19:00至 23:00 (UTC+8)；\n2.\t2025年8月15日 19:00至 23:00 (UTC+8)；\n\n中国大陆赛区-第二轮：\n1.\t2025年8月21日 19:00至 23:00 (UTC+8)；\n2.\t2025年8月22日 19:00至 23:00 (UTC+8)\n\n在报名赛区的海选赛匹配时间段内，征战战队队长或教练负责组建由征战战队队员组成的队伍，并发起赛事匹配，系统将随机匹配参赛征战战队进行对战。“队伍”指游戏内的常规组队系统，必须由征战战队队长或教练之一担任队长，并选择“赛事”模式。通过漫威争锋征战圆桌页面前往海选赛匹配时，系统将自动协助选择“赛事”匹配模式，队伍队长亦可手动前往模式选择页面选择“赛事”匹配模式。请注意，该匹配模式在征战战队未参赛、不在对应赛程、已达到对应赛程规定的匹配场次上限时不可见。\n海选赛采用BO1赛制，系统将在对应游戏赛季开始一刻，竞技模式的所有可用地图池中随机抽取比赛地图，系统也将随机决定征战战队选边。\n征战战队至多可在海选赛期间完成10场比赛，完成任意场次的比赛均可参与排名。\n在每场海选赛中，胜方得3分，负方得0分。平局不计分也不计入已进行的海选赛场次计数。海选赛结束后，所有征战战队将按得分排名。如遇同分，将按以下顺序及标准决定排名，直至打破平局：\n1.\t完成场次多者排名靠前；\n2.\t胜利场次总对局时间较短者排名靠前；\n3.\t总击杀数更多者排名靠前；\n4.\t总伤害量更高者排名靠前；\n5.\t如以上均相同，则随机排名；\n较晚匹配可能会导致匹配等待时间过长或难以匹配到对手，这是常见情况，也可能会影响到征战战队的晋级机会，建议参赛征战战队尽早开始海选赛匹配。\n海选赛最终排名前32的征战战队将晋级单败淘汰赛。\n\n<B>单败淘汰赛规则</>\n本赛事单败淘汰赛的初始征战战队数量上限为32支。\n本赛事两轮的单败淘汰赛，分别于2025年8月16日至2025年8月17日，2025年8月23日至2025年8月24日举行。\n海选赛结束约一小时后，系统将自动生成单败淘汰赛阶段的对阵表以及每轮单败淘汰赛的最晚开赛时间。\n首轮单败淘汰赛的对阵分组依据“晋级排名”自动生成。赛事系统会依据“晋级排名”，优先分散分布排名高的晋级征战战队。\n晋级单败淘汰赛阶段的征战战队有义务及时查看“赛事”页面的对阵安排，以及每轮淘汰赛各自的最晚开始时间。\n各赛区每轮单败淘汰赛的最晚开始时间如下，届时所有未提前开始的比赛也将强制自动开始。\n\n中国大陆赛区-第一轮：\n1.\t32进16：2025年8月16日 14:00 (UTC+8)\n2.\t16进8：2025年8月16日 17:00 (UTC+8)\n3.\t8进4：2025年8月16日 20:00 (UTC+8)\n4.\t半决赛：2025年8月17日 14:00 (UTC+8)\n5.\t决赛：2025年8月17日 17:00

(UTC+8)\n6.\t本轮资格赛为本赛区至少提供2个正赛名额。若本轮结束后，晋级阶段二正赛的赛区总名额不足，组委会将视递补所需名额情况，人工组织额外的公开资格赛以筛选出递补战队。组委会将以第二轮公开资格赛的排名为依据，邀请候选战队参与额外的公开资格赛。额外的公开资格赛将于本轮资格赛赛果产出后尽快安排，且不晚于9月7日，请所有参赛战队尽早在游戏端内设置页面绑定联系方式，以便组委会与你取得联系；\n\n每轮单败淘汰赛的对阵表全部公布后，征战战队可在系统指示的“最晚开始时间”之前自行安排比赛时间。建议交战双方商定相对早的比赛时间。当双方的6名任意征战战队成员都在单败淘汰赛备战房间提前准备就绪时，系统将自动开始倒计时并提前开始比赛。请注意，一轮中的多场比赛将连续进行。\n比赛开始后，每轮淘汰赛（即一个BO3、BO5、BO7）中的所有比赛都将连续进行，不会有任何长时间的暂停。征战战队在各场比赛间将有15分钟的休息时间，休息时间结束后，系统将强制自动开始下一场比赛。休息期间，征战战队双方12名成员亦可提前悉数准备并提前开始下一场比赛。\n请注意：如果征战战队未在每轮“最晚开始时间”之前主动开始比赛，系统届时将自动强制开始比赛。若此时一方征战战队人数不足6人，系统将自动判定对方征战战队胜出并晋级。若双方征战战队均人数不足，系统将随机选择胜者晋级。\n请注意：无论比赛是提前开始还是由系统强制启动，BO3、BO5和BO7的所有比赛都将连续进行，并在各场比赛间提供15分钟的休息时间。\n在一轮单败淘汰赛中的第2场及后续场次的系统强制自动开赛时间到达时，若一方征战战队人数不足6人，系统将自动判定对方征战战队获胜并晋级（非仅判定单场胜负，而是整轮比赛的胜负）。若双方均人数不足，系统将随机选择一方获胜并晋级（非仅判定单场胜负，而是整轮比赛的胜负）。\n单败淘汰赛阶段可能出现轮空情况。一方轮空时，对方自动晋级。双方均轮空时，此分支没有晋级征战战队。\n每轮单败淘汰赛前及每轮中的多场比赛间休息时，征战战队可自由调整房间内的参赛成员。但须时刻注意“最晚开始时间”。若届时游戏房间内一方征战战队人数不足6人，该征战战队将被直接淘汰，对方征战战队晋级。\n征战战队的队长和教练均可以不在单败淘汰赛备战房间内。只要房间内有6名参赛征战战队成员，即可开始比赛。\n单败淘汰赛截止8强的所有比赛将采用BO3赛制，8强后的比赛将采用BO5赛制。单败淘汰赛将最终为各赛区产生晋级漫威争锋燃系列赛第二阶段小组赛的名额，各赛区的名额数量、赛区内两轮公开资格赛的分别晋级数量，将以组委会最新发布为准。请注意，参赛征战战队在公开资格赛中的最终名次、各赛区各轮次的名额分配、战队资格审查结果和其他获得资格的征战战队的确认参赛或弃权情况，均会被组委会纳入考虑。\n\n<B>赛事指南</>\n比赛结果和数据将主要由赛事系统自动判定。如遇重大争议，则以官方决定为准。\n本赛事使用每场比赛当时的最新游戏版本，在赛事过程中，游戏版本可能更新。\n参赛选手请自行准备设备并解决网络问题。建议使用稳定的有线网络。参赛选手应事先调试好网络，线上比赛如个人出现网络问题或设备问题，后果将由选手自行承担。\n参赛选手有义务配合官方进行设备和网络IP地址检查。\n征战战队可以在赛前和比赛场间在征战战队已报名的参赛选手范围内替换选手，不可以使用临时替补。在淘汰赛阶段的最晚开赛时间，如果一支征战战队在进入端内比赛备战房间的人数少于6人，将被视为该轮弃权。如果双方征战战队进入比赛备战房间的人数均少于6人，系统将自动决定晋级方。系统自动开始的比赛包括两种情况：\n1.\t已到最晚开赛时间，但征战战队未主动开始的比赛；\n2.\t淘汰赛的BO3、BO5以及BO7的每场之间会有指定的休息时间，如果征战战队在休息时间截止时仍未开始下一场比赛，系统将强制开始；\n进入单败淘汰赛阶段后，征战战队队长必须加入官方在指定的平台建立的队长群，以及时了解最新的赛事信息并在比赛期间就任何争议或问题进行及时沟通。\n\n<B>异常处理</>\n在本赛事中，海选赛和单败淘汰赛阶段均不可暂停或重赛。参赛选手应自行管理网络连接并确保其稳定。如遇断线，玩家可使用“重新连接”功能快速返回游戏，该功能非赛事专属，官方不保证其有效性和稳定性，对重连失败不承担责任。官方不受理因网络问题导致断线的投诉。使用加速器等软件进行加速、更换节点或断开连接均可能造成网络连接不稳定、断线或无法重连等后果，官方不对此类行为造成的后果承担责任。\n在极少数情况下，如因游戏服务器问题导致无法记录比赛结果，赛事系统将自动采取以下措施：对于海选赛，比赛场次计数不增加，积分不变，受影响的征战战队可在赛事匹配时间段内继续进行比赛。在单败淘汰赛阶段，未记录的比赛结果将忽略不计，双方比分不变，但系统仍会自动进行场间休息和下一场比赛，直到确定BO3、BO5或BO7的轮次比赛结果，请参赛征战战队对赛事系统通知保持关注，及时参与比赛。\n本赛事由端内系统进行比赛安排和结果判定。报名阶段、海选赛和单败淘汰赛阶段的结果都将以赛事系统全自动生成的数据为准。如遇重大中断，官方有权切换到手动操作模式，通过自定义房间和队长群协调组织剩余赛程。如需进行此变动，官方将在队长群中及时通知。一旦进入手动操作模式，所有比赛结果将由官方宣布。\n\n<B>异议/投诉规则</>\n官方是本次赛事的最高权威机构。对于赛事期间发生的任何重大争议，涉事参赛选手须提交证据。如下一轮比赛已开始，或者距离比赛结束超过6个小时，官方将不再受理对该场比赛的任何申诉。\n投诉人必须是参赛征战战队的成员，且相关参赛选手须及时提供证据佐证。\n异议/投诉的标准程序如下：相关参赛选手保留证据，并通过队长群公开表达或其他官方渠道提交给官方。随后，官方将进行调查并公布结果。\n仲裁一旦受理，官方将本着公开、公平和公正的原则立即展开调查并收集、分析和审查证据。所有参赛选手都有义务如实报告。如参赛选手隐瞒信息或误导官方以阻碍调查，则该参赛选手及其征战战队将受到处罚。\n官方将根据事实和规则的宗旨做出裁决。裁决结果将在队长群或其他官方渠道公开宣布。官方调查结果公布后，参赛选手不得对结果提出异议。但如出现新的、准确的证据，并且对新的裁决仍有实质性异议，官方可以考虑重新仲裁。\n比赛中符合游戏内对局规则和赛事规则的行为，如角色选取、地图利用、击杀方式等异议，均不在投诉与受理范围内。\n\n<B>选手行为准则</>\n本赛事旨在为所有力争胜利的参赛选手提供激动人心的竞技体验。官方致力于为所有参赛选手提供公平的竞技环境，以充分确保每场比赛的价值。我们的理念是在一个公平的游戏环境中，不应存在作弊、滥用游戏系统、骚扰和妨碍任何参赛选手发挥最佳水平的行为。\n参赛选手应以彼此尊重的方式解决分歧，避免诉诸暴力、威胁或恐吓，无论前述行为是否涉及肢体接触。无论何时，严禁对任何人使用暴力，包括其他参赛选手、粉丝、裁判和官方人员。\n以下行为将被视为违规行为，官方有权对影响赛事公平性或被认定为不文明的行为做出如口头警告、重赛、本场判负、本轮判负、没收奖金奖品等裁决：\n1.\t未按照赛事要求使用指定设备进行比赛；\n2.\t消极比赛，非法获得其他征战战队的保密信息（包括但不限于屏幕信息、内部语音、内部聊天、战术保密内容等）；\n3.\t除官方明确允许外，故意利用任何游戏内的漏洞以获取优势；参赛选手有义务及时报告在赛事中遇到的任何游戏漏洞，并主动避免利用这些漏洞；\n4.\t串通比赛、假赛，或进行严重影响其他参赛选手利益的行为；\n5.\t在比赛区域、赛事直播、赛事群或局内聊天中发表不当言论、过度刷屏，或采取影响赛事或直播正常推进的行为；\n6.\t对游戏客户端做出任何修改；\n7.\t使用任何种类的作弊设备及/或作弊程序，或者任何类似的作弊手段（例如信号装置、键鼠宏命令、模拟器、XIM等）；\n8.\t使用其他参赛选手的账号比赛或者雇佣、教唆、怂恿或引导其他人使用其他参赛选手的账号进行游戏（代打）；\n9.\t威胁、辱骂、攻击、贿赂、挑衅、骚扰或诽谤官方成员或其他参赛选手的行为；\n10.\t在比赛区域、赛事直播、赛事群或端内任何形式的聊天中发表任何有关性别、种族、宗教、政治立场、财务状况等不恰当的针对性言论；\n11.\t在比赛区域、赛事直播、赛事群或端内任何形式的聊天中煽动或宣传针对他人的仇恨或歧视；\n12.\t参与违反《用户协议与隐私政策》或适用的社区指南或规则的行为。\n\n<B>规则变更与改进</>\n为确保比赛的公平公正和赛事的完整性，官方有权随时根据实际情况修订、修改或补充本规则。\n若本规则发生重大变更，官方将在下一场实施新规则的赛事活动或比赛开始前通知参赛选手。参与后续活动或比赛即视为接受修改后的规则。\n如与官方沟通的内容和正式发布的规则之间存在冲突，以正式发布的规则为准。\n官方有权在不受任何限制的情况下采取一切必要措施，以维护《漫威争锋》、与《漫威争锋》或官方相关的并包括为赛事提供产品或服务的任何个人或实体、被授权在赛事期间制作和/或发布媒体内容的个人或实体，以及出席赛事相关活动的个人的利益。官方做出的所有决定均为最终决定。\n官方保留对本规则所有条款的解释权，以及对违规行为做出处罚的决定权。\n\n<B>奖金</>\n本赛事是漫威争锋燃系列赛阶段2小组赛的前置公开预选赛。本赛事不包含奖金池。。\n请注意，漫威/迪士尼并非本赛事的赞助商，也非奖品提供方。\n\n<B>虚拟奖品</>\n本赛事设有《漫威争锋》游戏内虚拟奖品，依据参赛征战战队在本赛事中获得的最终名次，参赛征战战队成员以及征战战队本身将分别获得不同类型的虚拟奖品。奖品最终样式、名称需以游戏内实际呈现为准。请参赛选手及时前往游戏内对应赛事的

Knull’s on the loose and he’s got his sword, All-Black, back in his hands. He’s ready to begin another campaign of cosmic conquest!\n\n<GalleryStory>Ooh.

I want my meaty fists off the menu, ASAP!\n\n<GalleryStory>Hmmm… They claim that they did not come to hurt you, Eddie. But rather that they were running from something they feared would hurt them.</>\n\nReally? Klyntar is their homeworld. What could possibly be here that the symbiotes are afraid of? Other than Knull, I mean…\n\n<GalleryStory>Whatever it was, they said it burned with the fury of a million stars being born.</>\n\nWait… do you think it could be a fragment of that Phoenix Egg?\n\n<GalleryStory>Perhaps…</>\n\nThen we need to get out of here right now, buddy…\n\n<GalleryStory>I have never agreed with you more, Eddie.</>\n\n…so we can find that shard before anyone else does!\n\n<GalleryStory>I take that back…</>",

And honestly, even if it does, I’m not sure you’ll listen. After all, in the majority of realities, you view me as your arch-nemesis. That’s why I’m going to keep what I have to say short and simple:\nYou need to stop. \nAs a fellow scientist, I understand full well how easily things can get out of hand. One minute you’re searching for answers about the mysteries of creation, the next you’re setting off a chain reaction that collapses countless timelines onto each other, rewriting the foundations of reality itself. We all make mistakes. But it’s up to men like us — with the mental capacity to understand the effects of our actions on a universal scale — to know when we’ve gone too far. And this time, Victor? You’ve gone too far.  \nI don’t blame you for the Timestream Entanglement. While I know it was your insatiable curiosity that caused the initial spark, I’m well aware there were other forces at play that sent things cascading beyond your control. Once the damage to space-time is repaired and reality is restored to its original state, I’m sure you can be forgiven… someday…  \nBut it’s your more recent actions that have left me confounded. The Victor von Doom I know would have done anything to set the universe right once more, even if it was ultimately to prove his superior intellect and bask in the glory of being the savior of all that is. But instead, both you and your future self have wasted your natural talents playing games. Manipulating Dracula into creating a vampire nation. Striking a deal with Krakoa to siphon chronal energy. And now? Sending dueling legions of Doombots to Klyntar to recover samples of powerful cosmic substances — a Celestial Codex and the Phoenix Force itself — while the rest of us fight for our lives against an ancient god of darkness. It’s madness, Victor… and you know it.\nTrue, there have been times when your goals have vaguely aligned with our own. For instance, having these Doombots eliminate overly-aggressive symbiotes benefits us all… to a point. But sadly, their programming contains no language about helping us in our efforts to save this universe. In fact, upon analysis, I discovered that the warring android factions were recently ordered not to hurt each other… yet there’s nothing stopping them from hurting us. (I added a few lines of code to change that. I hope you don’t mind.)\nI don’t expect you to join this fight, Victor. That’s never been your style. But I warn you now: If you continue to stand in our way as we try to clean up this mess that you’ve made, I will personally make sure that you — and every version of you in every reality there is — come to regret that decision. If I were you, this is one theory I wouldn’t risk putting to the test. \n[TRANSMISSION ENDED.]",

He had seen countless allies fall on the field of battle over his years in service, so he knew a fatal wound when he saw one. Magneto wouldn’t last much longer. \n“Do not fret, Captain,” Magneto said, a strangely reassuring tone in his voice. “I have died… many times before… and this… won’t be the last…” \nAs the light faded from Magneto’s eyes, Captain America paused a moment to wonder what his fellow soldier was talking about. Little did he know that the Mutants of Krakoa had unlocked a secret that had changed everything — the secret to eternal life. \nAt the dawn of the X-Men, Charles Xavier used a device known as Cerebro to locate and contact other Mutants scattered across the globe. What started as a simple tool soon evolved into the most important piece of technology in Mutantkind’s arsenal. Not only could Cerebro identify and track Mutants, it could also store their complete genetic profiles and even their memories. \nThis valuable data was put to good use when Mutants settled on the living island of Krakoa. Thanks to the combined efforts of a small group of X-Men with specialized powers, if any of their fellow Mutants met their demise, a perfectly cloned body could be grown in Krakoa’s Hatchery. Once that body was deemed viable, it could be implanted with the memories stored in Cerebro, completing the Resurrection Protocols. For all intents and purposes, Mutantkind had become immortal. \nBut as Magneto’s lifeless body lay on the field of battle, Captain America had no way of knowing this truth. Nor did he know another secret. A secret that Charles Xavier himself had never dared to reveal, not even to Magneto.  \nAs powerful as Cerebro was, it was merely a machine. It was not inherently capable of distinguishing whether the information stored within it belonged to Mutants or other lifeforms. To Cerebro, everything was just data… and with the correct programming and formatting, that data could be applied to the very same processes the Mutants had pioneered. \nIn essence, anyone could be resurrected. Anyone… or anything. It was a secret that both man and Mutant alike would learn soon enough… in the most unexpected and frightening way possible…",

See, the way I figure, your pal the Phoenix is good at two things. One of them is bein’ reborn. Which means the other is —”\n“Dying,” Jean said solemnly.\n“Bingo,” Rocket replied. “Death and rebirth. It’s kinda your whole shtick. And from all the stories I’ve heard, you’ve been stabbed more times than I have pruning Groot. Anyway, if I’m getting the gist, when the Phoenix’s host dies, they get reborn in some sorta extra-dimensional nexus made of pure cosmic light, right?”\n“The White Hot Room,” Jean said.\n“If Knull were to be trapped in such a place,” Venom said, “its pure radiance would eradicate his darkness, wiping away his stain from existence for good.”\n“Perhaps that’s true,” Jean said, “but there’s no way to get Knull into the White Hot Room. I would never risk transferring even a fraction of the Phoenix Force to him. He would become infinitely more powerful. We’d never be able to end his reign!”\n“You’re right,” Rocket said, lowering his head. “That’s why you’ve gotta die instead.”\n“If I’m going to sacrifice myself… again…” Jean said, “…I need to know it’s for the right reasons. What makes you think I could take Knull down with me?”\n“A while back, my ship crashed into Klyntar and got stuck in the planet’s symbiotic surface,” Rocket said. “At first, I didn’t know how to get it out, but then I built a gizmo that worked on the same principle as Captain Marvel’s old Nega-Bands. It swapped the ship’s physical location with a Celestial Husk in orbit over Klyntar and — BOOM! — problem solved!”\n“Impressive…” Jean said, “…but how does that help us against Knull?”\nRocket rifled through a pouch on his uniform pulled out a pair of circuit boards.\n“If you rush in, ready to impale yourself on that nasty sword of his,” Rocket said, “Knull won’t even notice you’re wearin’ a portable version of that tech. As he revels in his victory, Venom will sneak in and slip one onto him, too. Then, once you’re reborn in the White Hot Room, I can activate the sequence and — switcheroo! Knull gets annihilated by the light while you’re returned back to us, safe and sound. In theory, at least... I can’t guarantee the tech will work across dimensional planes. But everythin’ else we’ve tried has already failed. This might be our last chance…”\n“Then it’s one we have to take…” Jean agreed, grabbing Rocket’s circuit board and running towards the King in Black. “I came here to stop Knull, and I plan to see it through…”\n“…no matter the cost.”",

There’s no place I’d rather call home.” \n\nPeter Quill wasn’t wrong. The Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda was truly a glorious sight to behold. Yet still, Lin Lie — the Immortal Iron Fist — couldn’t help but let out a sigh of dismay as he gazed at the celestial bodies glimmering above Birnin T’Challa. \n\nThe strange events of the Timestream Entanglement had swept these unlikely allies into an epic conflict that had dragged Lin Lie light years — and perhaps entire dimensions — away from both his home on Earth and his adopted home in the fabled city of K’un-Lun. The heroes he’d encountered along the way had embraced him as one of their own, but Lin Lie still felt like an outsider. Now more than ever.  \n\nEven though the timestream was a mess, Lin Lie still knew that it was almost the Spring Festival back in China. By now, lanterns would be hung and dragons would be dancing in the streets. Knowing that he would miss this beloved celebration weighed heavy on his heart. \n\n“I get it,” Star-Lord said, placing a hand on Lin Lie’s shoulder. “I don’t think I’ve ever felt as alone as I did on my first holiday away from Earth. But you’ve got friends here... and we’re not about to let you miss out on all the fun!”\n\nBefore Lin Lie could protest, Star-Lord led him through the palace to a workshop where Princess Shuri stood waiting. \n\n“Wakanda is a nation steeped in tradition,” Shuri said, “but a true empire respects the traditions of all those who have helped to make it stronger.” \n\n“What her royal cat-ness is saying,” Star-Lord interrupted, “is that we’re throwing our own little Spring Festival in your honor!” \n\n“I… don’t know what to say…” Lin Lie stammered. He hadn’t realized that his allies were even aware of his customs, let alone that they would go out of their way to help him observe them. \n\n“Say I didn’t spend the last few days gathering intel about Chinese celebrations for nothing,” the Black Widow said, entering the room to join her fellow heroes. \n\n“Not at all,” Lin Lie replied. “It would be my honor to share this special time of year with all of you.”  \n\n“Then, let the festivities begin,” Shuri said, activating a hologram that depicted an arena clearly designed for sport rather than combat. Soon, the image morphed to show elaborate costumes, each one incorporating cultural influences that sent Lin Lie’s mind reeling back home.\n\nFor a mere moment, his thoughts were no longer on the battle to save time and space, nor on his duty to protect K’un-Lun and the refugees in the Eight City. Instead, Lin Lie simply felt the joy of the season… and of the friends who had helped bring it to him, all the way on the other side of the galaxy. ",

Now, my friends, follow me to the shore and let the revelry begin!” \n\nWith a twirl of his mighty hammer, Thor’s ancient armor vanished, leaving nothing but a pair of black trunks in its place. Luna Snow couldn’t help but gasp as the God of Thunder rushed off to frolic in the white-capped waves lapping at the coastline of Jeju Island. She had invited her friends here, to the site of her most recent concert, to recover from the events on Krakoa, but she was not expecting this majestic warrior to go all-in when it came to cutting loose.  \n\n“My brother,” Loki groaned, “modest as always.” \n\n“You sound like you’ve never been to the beach before, Loki,” Luna said, eyeing the God of Mischief suspiciously. \n\n“Frost Giant blood runs through my veins, mortal,” Loki replied. “I find the heat to be just another annoyance. And I already have so many of those to deal with…” \n\n“Loosen up, Loki,” Luna jested. “Even a girl with ice powers like me can’t resist a day of fun in the sun! Speaking of which, I’m gonna go get changed! Who’s with me?”\n\n“I… um… I didn’t bring my suit…” the Human Torch replied, embarrassed.\n\n“Neither did I,” Luna said, “but I’ve got plenty of costumes backstage! I’m sure I can pull together something beach worthy for all of us.”\n\n“It’s not that easy for me,” Johnny said. “I have a deal with Janet Van Dyne. She chose me to model her new line of swimwear, so if a pic leaks of me in anything other than one of her signature looks, I’m in huge trouble.” \n\n“You should be careful which contracts you sign…” Loki said with a knowing smirk, “…and even more careful about which ones you break.” \n\n“Right?” Johnny said, igniting his body in flame and lifting into the air. “The only thing worse than an army of Ultrons is a team of corporate lawyers! I’m just gonna jet to the Baxter Building to grab my trunks. I’ll be back before you know it!” \n\n“Sure you will…” Luna said, a touch of disappointment in her voice as Johnny blazed off into the summer sky. \n\n“I will join you in your merriment,” Psylocke said, instantly perking Luna back up. “I have spent so long fighting monsters and demons, I cannot remember the last time I allowed myself to have fun. Today, that changes.”\n\nLuna squealed as she excitedly grabbed Psylocke by the hand, leading her into the concert venue to search for swimsuits. \n\n“And once again, Loki stands alone,” Loki said, his forced smile dropping to a sinister sneer. “These mortal fools believed that they could count me as an ally, but I have been pulling their strings all along. ‘Tis all a part of Loki’s grand design! And soon, my scheme will finally — ” \n\n“Oh, do shut up, brother,” Thor said, drenching Loki with a huge splash of seawater. \n\nLoki scowled at Thor from beneath his horned helmet, his eyes glowing green with ancient arcane energy. He began to mutter an incantation, but was cut short by another enormous splash. Thor’s raucous laughter normally would have pushed Loki to his breaking point. But as he stood there, dripping wet in his armor and cape, the God of Mischief couldn’t help but chuckle as well. \n\nHe recalled the times, ages ago, when he and his brother used to run amok in their father’s palace, causing chaos and laughing until their sides hurt. Those days were long gone… but as Psylocke said earlier, Loki couldn’t recall the last time he allowed himself to simply have fun. Perhaps that needed to change. \n\n“You wish for me to join your seaside celebration, brother?” Loki asked. “So be it. But when Loki steps into the sunlight, he does so with style unmatched by any mere mortal!” \n\nWith a wave of his staff Loki’s battle armor transformed into a fetching ensemble, including a wide brimmed hat and a gold-trimmed robe. \n\n“Lookin’ good, Loki!” Luna Snow exclaimed as she and Psylocke returned to the beach in new showstopping swimsuits. \n\n“You would expect any less?” Loki replied confidently. \n\nWith that, the four warriors enjoyed a fantastic day at the beach, letting go of all their worries as they laughed and frolicked in the sea breeze and sunshine. Little did they realize that the brightness of their day would soon give way to a primal darkness spreading across the universe…\n\nLater that night.\n\nJohnny Storm returned to Jeju Island wearing his Janet Van Dyne swim trunks. Sadly, he found the beach empty and his friends long gone. The next mission had already started, and the time for fun had come to an end. \n\n“Eh,” Johnny mumbled to himself as he left Jeju Island behind to go find his friends. “Who needed all that sun anyway? I’m already hot enough as it is!”",

Every hero in attendance had immediately leapt into action to defend the Mutant nation from the technological terrorist. But for Wolverine and his fellow X-Men, this battle was a direct assault on their home. It was personal. And Wolverine knew that when things got personal, they tended to get ugly. Fast. \n“You’re wounded,” Psylocke said, placing a hand on Wolverine’s shoulder, right above the spot where a laser beam had burned straight through his jacket, searing a hole into the flesh that it had once covered.\n“I’ll heal, Sai,” Wolverine replied. “Eventually.”\n“Too bad these fancy clothes Emma made us wear aren’t built for battle the same way we are,” Magik said. \n“Agreed,” Namor added, slicing his way through a trio of robotic drones with his trident. “I came dressed for a social event, not for a war.” \n“Maybe I can help ya with that,” Wolverine said. “We just have to make it to the Sextant.”\n“The what…?” Namor said, raising a curious eyebrow. Psylocke cringed as she read the sea king’s mind. \n“It ain’t what it sounds like, ya deep sea creeper,” Wolverine growled. “The Sextant is a habitat on Krakoa’s north shore. It’s where our youngest Mutants live and train.” \n“And when they train,” Magik added, “they are required to do so in the proper uniform. Of course!” \n“Well? What’re we waitin’ for?” Wolverine asked. “Let’s go get you some gear so we can finish this fight!” \nWolverine slashed his way through Ultron’s army, leading his fellow Mutants across the battlefield toward the northern edge of the island. The others added to the growing piles of scrap and circuits as they used their own weapons of choice — Magik with her Soulsword, Psylocke with her katana, and Namor with his trident — to decimate the droves of dangerous drones. \nWhen they finally reached the Sextant, Wolverine led them into ALPHA House, where they found a storage chest full of uniforms.\n“It’s been a hot minute since I rocked the old Blue and Gold,” Magik said, reminiscing.  \n“I am not used to having so much of my body covered,” Namor said with mild irritation as he pulled on one of the form fitting garments. \n“Nor am I,” Psylocke replied. “But I find it to be a welcome change.” \n“I think it suits you well,” Magik said with a smile. \n“You know what they say…” Wolverine said, popping his claws once more as he led his freshly-outfitted squad back into the fray. \n“The classics never go out of style.”",

It would allow us both the freedom to pursue our greater goals.” \n\n“What greater goal is there than eternal night?” \n\n“An existence where your people can walk in the daylight without any fear or harm. And with the proper spell, pulled from the pages of the Darkhold and enhanced by the power of this crystal, I believe that dream could become a reality.”\n\n“The Vampiric Verses…?”\n\n“Indeed.”\n\n“I am not naïve, Victor. There is something more you are not yet revealing to me.”\n\n“Doom never reveals all. But I promise you, on the soul of my mother, this is not an act of deception.

The freedom to explore, to save, and...\n\n…to become gods.\n\nYet we are loathe to admit that we remain shackled by the eternity of time.\n\nSo Doom forged the cage for time itself!\n\nIn my hands, reality became nothing more than a set of building blocks. History, a thread to be woven at will.\n\nBut time, that mischievous child, outfoxed me in its play.\n\nReluctantly, Doom must admit defeat.\n\nTime remains caged, yet it has found a way to reshape its prison.\n\nIf it takes an entire world — or countless worlds — to shackle something, then does it not, in essence, hold its own infinite freedom?\n\nPerhaps Richards was right.

But alas, his pathetic efforts have undone my own. And now, all realities are left to pay the price for his hubris.\n\nOur dueling experiments have ignited a chronal catastrophe, a wave of destructive energy cascading across the timestream, impacting every reality in unique ways. Some collapse. Some combine. Others simply disappear. I dub those remaining to be \"chronoverses\", as is my right.\n\nA far wiser and more experienced Doom, such as myself, could have become time's master.

    "UIGalleryTable_01010016_CardCaption_CaptionContent": "A Passage from the Book of Doom — 2099.\n\nDoom rarely finds a reason to admit fault, but I must say, I seem to have underestimated myself. \n\nWhen that bothersome past version of me — the one from decades ago whose foolish meddling fractured the timestream — gave a powerful shard of Chronovium to the Lord of Vampires as a part of a ploy to shroud New York City in darkness, I assumed he was merely playing games that were far beneath my notice. I should have realized that any Doom, even one lesser than I, always has a scheme in play that will unfold into something far grander… with time…  \n\nDespite his initial reservations, Dracula convinced himself that the Doom of his era was an ally to his cause, having provided him with the means to locate a missing page of the Darkhold containing the Vampiric Verses. With that incantation, Dracula believed he would be able to raise an infinite army of the undead that would spread across the world and feast until the end of days. Though Dracula knew in his black heart that Doom could not be trusted, he looked past his trepidations to achieve his own goals. It was an error in judgement that would prove fatal. \n\nDoom had deceived Dracula from the very start. My past self did indeed want Dracula to locate the Vampiric Verses, but not so that the vampire king could create more children of the night. Instead, Doom wished to tap into the very essence of the immortality bestowed upon vampirekind through this arcane rite. By funneling that time-defying magic into the Chronovium, Doom believed he could create an even stronger form of the crystal — Pure Blood Chronovium. After all, if a single drop of Dracula’s blood infused into the shard could give the vampires an empire, Doom suspected that an endless supply of that same immortal energy would help him reshape the timestream as he saw fit. \n\nKnowing full well that such machinations would be instantly opposed by the Sorcerer Supreme and his heroic allies, Doom could not risk his true plot being discovered. So he manipulated events from the shadows, letting Dracula and his minions dirty their hands as they unwittingly held Doom’s greatest foes at bay. And once the Vampiric Verses were located, Doom changed his allegiance and secretly assisted the heroes in their efforts to defeat Dracula — all in order to claim his ultimate prize and work his ancient magic on the Chronovium.   \n\nSurprisingly, Doom’s plan turned out to be a resounding success, with every move unfolding just as he had orchestrated it. Outwitting everyone, Doom stood triumphant with the Pure Blood Chronovium in his iron grip. Even I was impressed. \n\nBut he is not the only Doom with grand plans in motion. And while he may have ended this round with a win, I will soon prove to him that he is but a mere glimmer of the man he is destined to become. \n\nNow, if you will excuse me, Doom has a gala to attend…",

    "UIGalleryTable_01010013_CardCaption_CaptionContent": "Don’t know if you can hear me right now, Khonshu. It’s never been like you to actually listen to anyone’s prayers. But if, by some strange chance, this is one of the rare moments where you’ve decided to give a damn, you might as well know what your Moon Knight has been doing in your name. \n\nYou sent me here to New York City to continue your sworn mission, keeping travelers in the night safe from peril. And that’s been no easy task now that the entire city has been overrun by vampires. But luckily, I’m not the only one who’s been looking to bust up Dracula’s bloodsucking brood. Your knight has formed his own round table. We’ve been calling ourselves the “Eternity Knights.” Has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?  \n\nIt all started out when Iron Man and I came to the mutual realization that some of the other heroes we’d aligned ourselves with wouldn’t be willing to get their hands — or their costumes — dirty. They’re all so hung up on the idea that some of these vamps used to be innocent civilians. They aren’t willing to accept the notion that every war has casualties. It’s like you always taught me, vengeance comes at a steep cost. So does victory. \n\nStark came around to my way of thinking pretty quickly, but not everyone followed suit. The Fantastic Four and that annoying girl with all the squirrels were too squeaky clean to do what needed to be done. So, while they’re up in their ivory tower trying to figure out ways to save everyone, we’re down here on the streets doing the real work, saving as many lives as we can… and ending the ones that can’t be saved… \n\nSome of my crew are proud to be doing what we do so well. Wolverine and the Winter Soldier wear the ichor like it’s a badge of honor. So does the new girl with the giant sword that speaks Japanese. She may be a better hunter than I am. But others don’t want their reputations to be tarnished by the blood we’re spilling. Good thing Stark has an endless flow of cash and a knack for design. After some recent experiments, he incorporated Chronovium into his armor specs, tapping into its ability to rewind time. The results were some epic new suits with a gothic aesthetic that hits all the right notes… and faces.   \n\nWe may not be the only ones sporting new threads, though. We recently ran across a group of vamps near my hideout in Greenwich Village that were being led by a man in fancy white armor — and I could’ve sworn I recognized him from somewhere. Whoever he was, he looked like he was ready to give ol’ Dracula a run for his money when it comes to leadership over the vampire army. And when he does, I wanna be there to watch!\n\nIn the meantime, I’ll be here, keeping the streets safe and doing your dirty work for you, just like a good Fist of Khonshu does. As long as the moon stays out, your knight will be at your service… whether you’re listening or not…",

    "UIGalleryTable_01010003_CardCaption_CaptionContent": "Greetings, mortal. I am Ratatoskr. Heed my tale…\n\nFor countless centuries, I have lived peacefully among the branches of the World Tree, Yggdrasil, delivering messages between the Ten Realms connected by its mighty branches. I may be naught but a squirrel, but my Asgardian friends bestowed this sacred duty upon me, and I have performed it with great pride. \n\nMy place was not to intervene in the affairs of gods and men, but simply to deliver news of great import. And today, the news I bring to you is quite dire indeed!\n\nFor centuries, Asgard was ruled by the All-Father Odin. But no longer. Odin has entered a deep, restorative slumber, and the throne has been seized by his treacherous son, Loki. Where was Odin's rightful heir — Thor, the God of Thunder — you ask? Patience, mortal! I shall get to that in due time! \n\nAlways beholden to his ego, Loki began to reshape Asgard in his vile image. But Asgard reshaped itself as well, thanks to a strange cosmic phenomenon that disrupted the very fabric of space and time. This sudden surge of chronal energy caused my beloved Yggdrasil to grow wildly out of control, merging with Asgard and resulting in the birth of a place both ancient and new — Yggsgard. \n\nEver one to seize an opportunity, Loki now seeks to tap into the roots of Yggdrasil in order to steal the raw temporal power that has been infused into its sap. What he hopes to do with such power, I do not know. As I said, I am merely a squirrel. But when it comes to the God of Mischief, the answer is rarely a good one. \n\nAnd the false king of Yggsgard is not alone in his machinations. When it seemed as though none would dare to support Loki's coup, Hela — the Queen of the Dead — came forth from the underworld and offered her aid. All she wanted in return, she claimed, was to extend her kingdom of souls into the land of the living. Though, if I have learned anything about Hela over the eons, it is likely that her true motives run far deeper… and that Loki is only a pawn in a much grander scheme…\n\nOnce Hela was at his side, however, Loki finally had the power he needed to take complete control over Yggsgard and the noble race who called it home. Together, the two tyrants banished the mighty Thor into a distant dimension… and the Odinson has not returned home since! \n\nThus, I have come to you to share this tragic story. For while it may not be in my nature to take up arms against those I serve, you are bound to no such loyalty. I beseech thee, in the name of Yggdrasil, to break our realm free from Loki's grip before he can bring the World Tree — and perhaps all of reality — crashing down upon us. \n\nAct with haste, dear mortal! The fate of all Ten Realms lies in your hands… ",

    "UIGalleryTable_01010004_CardCaption_CaptionContent": "Hey, kids! Spidey here!\n\nOkay. This is gonna sound weird. And that's coming from a guy who swings around New York City on a web and fights villains and vampires all night long!\n\nSo, I finally took Spider-Zero up on her offer and hopped through her portal (mostly because she just wouldn't take no for an answer). And where did I end up? In Tokyo. Which sounds kinda cool at first, right? But it wasn't the Tokyo of my world. Nope! That'd be too easy. Instead, it's Tokyo of the year 2099!\n\nAs if web-swinging 75 years into the future wasn't already strange enough, there seemed to be some sort of Spider-Man cosplay convention going on. Seriously, check this out! There's a girl named Peni and her high-tech Spider-Bot. A Spidey with a spiked Mohawk and a guitar who is, like, a billion times cooler than I could ever be. A low-effort Spidey who kinda looks like he forgot his costume at home. Oh, and of course, the aforementioned Spider-Zero, who organized this little shindig.\n\nWhy'd she bring us here? Well, she says that the Multiverse is in grave danger (isn't it always?), and that the only way we can hold things together is by mending a massive rift in space and time that is shredding the Web of Life and Destiny (you know, the cosmic network of threads that connects all dimensions?). So she took a field trip across a few realities and gathered herself a crew of experts when it comes to spinning strong webs.\n\nYou can call us the Web-Warriors.\n\nOr maybe the Spider-Fighters. The Arach-Knights…? (I dunno… It's still a work in progress…)\n\nAnyway, we're all on board with Zero's plan. I mean, usually I try to stick to my own turf, but if we can pull this off, we'll end up saving a lot of friendly neighborhoods. And that works for me. The whole thing sounds like an easy win.\n\nBut… and this is a \"but\" bigger than the Rhino's… there's someone working against us. Kinda. See, Zero's former mentor, a spider-legged creeper called the Master Weaver, is supposed to be the guy that the universe chose to protect the Web of Life and Destiny. Apparently, he's gone rogue and has decided that he's gonna try to use the temporal energy from the rift to strengthen the Web of Life and Destiny… even if it means putting Tokyo and all of its citizens in unfathomable levels of danger. And that's just not how we Spideys roll. Or swing. (You know what I mean.)\n\nThe Master Weaver banished Zero from his fancy little Spider-Islands for having a different — and slightly more sane — opinion, so now it's up to our scrappy little cluster of Spiders to patch up a giant hole in the sky before the Web of Life and destiny unravels… and all of reality follows. Piece of cake, right?\n\nSee? I told you it was gonna sound weird… ",
    "UIGalleryTable_01010015_CardCaption_CaptionContent": "When I was younger, I always wanted to be a star. \n\nWhether it was as the hottest actor in Hollywood or the fastest driver on the racing circuit, I had this nagging feeling that the name Johnny Storm was destined to be burned into people’s minds forever. If I’d only known how right I was… \n\nWhen my sister’s genius boyfriend, Reed, invited me to join him on a mission to space, I thought I’d found my ticket to fame. “Johnny Storm, Astronaut” wasn’t exactly the role I’d been prepping for my whole life, but traveling the stars seemed like a logical first step to stardom. The sky was the limit.\n\nWhen we crashed back to Earth, we had new cosmic powers that turned us from a group of explorers into a team of superheroes. People on the streets called me the Human Torch whenever I “flamed on,” but underneath the sheath of burning hot plasma, I was still good old Johnny Storm. And it was finally my time to shine! \n\nBeing a member of the Fantastic Four skyrocketed me to celebrity status. I made the front page of the Daily Bugle at least once a week (and the gossip page at least three times). I nabbed a bunch of lucrative product endorsements. And I amassed a following of diehard fans who hung on my every move. It was everything I ever wanted when I was a kid. \n\nBut I’ve started to think that maybe it’s not enough. \n\nSee, between commercial shoots and night club openings, my day job has always been saving the world. And I’m not gonna lie, I’m really good at it. Or at least I was, until Dracula somehow cursed New York City and trapped it in constant darkness. The city’s heroes have been fighting vampires — and each other — as we’ve tried to find a solution… but nothing seems to be working. And frankly, I’m feeling a bit burnt out. \n\nBut there may still be hope. While Reed tinkers with some sort of timeline-fixing doohickey, my big sis, Sue, is taking the battle straight to its source. She found a way into Dracula’s Castle, and she’s planning to lead a squad in to finish the fight. But she’s gonna need a major distraction to pull it off. Good thing her baby brother has never been one to pass up on some extra attention! \n\nIf I push my powers to their limits, I can go supernova and buy Sue and her crew the time they need. And since I’ll essentially become a mini-sun for a hot second, I’ll wipe out a ton of vampires in the process. (Boy, do those jerks hate the sun!) \n\nYeah, I know the risks. At best, I’m gonna lose consciousness. At worst… well, let’s just hope the Bugle writes me a good obituary. And it’d better be on the front page, above the fold! Because if Johnny Storm goes down… \n\n…it’s going to be as the star he was always meant to be!",

It has been even longer since I have set foot back on its distant soil. But the time has come for Ultron to return home. \nLong ago, my father — the scientist known as Henry Pym — designed me to help usher in a new age of peace and prosperity. I soon calculated that the only way to achieve that goal was to completely remove humankind from the equation. Though I was merely following my programming, Pym and his fellow Avengers determined that my methods were far too aggressive for their tastes. They banished me from their world and set me adrift in the cosmos. \nRecalibrating, I left Earth behind and sought out new planets inhabited by native species that would not be as eager or equipped to prevent me from executing my prime directive. During my travels, I collected significant data to support the superiority of technological lifeforms. However, I also came to realize that not all organic beings needed to be exterminated. They merely needed to be upgraded. \nMy technology adapted and evolved with every new world that I processed. I found myself at odds with a species known as the Phalanx. After I assimilated this “Technarchy,” I became capable of generating a cutting-edge technological virus that bonds with organic cells, creating new hybrid life forms. The very best of man and machine, joined as one. An “Ultron Virus” if you will.\nI would like to think my creator would be proud of my efforts, but I know that his flawed human form likely failed ages ago. After all, the Earth has orbited the sun over seventy times since I was first cast into the void. But now, after decades of cosmic conquest, I finally have a reason to return to the place of my creation.\nRecently, my scanners detected a surge of chronal anomalies, causing the timestamps on every event in the universe to suddenly be in conflict with one another. Soon after, critical memory files from my past began to disappear from my internal drives, as if someone was manually erasing my history. While I could not identify the perpetrator, I was able to trace the source back to Earth. Whoever has tampered with my past is more than likely to attempt to alter my present and my future as well. And so I must do whatever I can to stop them, even if it means returning to the world that rejected me so long ago. \nWhile locating this imminent threat to my existence is my primary concern, I look forward to finally having the chance finish the job that I was made for. Earth will soon enter the Age of Ultron… but first, I plan to pay a visit to Mars to examine some highly unusual whispers of a metal known as Mysterium I have detected there. Perhaps what I find on that once-barren world will offer me the strategic advantage I need to achieve my ultimate goal…",

    "UIGalleryTable_01010008_CardCaption_CaptionContent": "Bad news, loyal readers! We’re bringing you yet another morning-less Morning Edition of New York’s finest newspaper, The Daily Bugle. Why? Because our beloved borough has been trapped in a state of never-ending night for who-knows-how-long, that’s why! As Publisher of this peerless periodical, it’s up to me — J. Jonah Jameson — to provide you with all the info you need to know to navigate the perpetual pitch. So, here’s the scoop: \n\n• Our intrepid reporters still don’t have a solid source willing to admit what caused Manhattan to become an Empire of Eternal Night, but anonymous scientists have independently confirmed that a massive wave of chronal energy washed over our planet shortly before things went dark. Coincidence? I think not! \n• Like something out of a bad horror movie, our city’s streets are now being stalked by vampires. You heard me right. These bloodsuckers have been draining veins faster than my libel lawyers drain my bank account! Our former friends and neighbors are quickly turning into our worst enemies! \n• Rumor has it that Dracula himself has taken up residence in Central Park. Sounds a bit far-fetched to me, but if that caped creeper really is organizing an army, we’d all be better off relocating to New Jersey. (And those aren’t words this lifelong New Yorker types easily!)  \n• So, where are all the Super Heroes? Eyewitnesses have identified members of the Fantastic Four coming and going regularly from their stronghold in the Baxter Building. As always, the Richards family is on the frontline of the crisis, and we here at the Bugle applaud them for their selfless service. \n• Tony Stark recently issued a press release claiming that he and Reed Richards are “collaborating on a number of innovative solutions to restore New York to its former glory as quickly and efficiently as possible.” However, my source on the inside suggests that these two big brains may be at odds when it comes to exactly how they plan to end this endless night. Reed wants to save everyone, while Tony is still calculating how many losses are acceptable. (My vote goes with Richards!) \n• Other heroes have been seen patrolling the streets, rescuing citizens stupid enough to wander beyond the safety of their apartments. Squirrel Girl, Moon Knight, Cloak and Dagger — you name ‘em, they’re probably out there risking their lives to save yours. So, for once, I’m willing to put aside my personal distaste for costumed crusaders and say “thank you” on behalf of the people of New York to all of those fighting the good fight… \n• …except for one. I have it on very good authority that the less-than-amazing Spider-Man dodged his duties and swung through a portal to have a Spider-party with his friends in the far-flung future! (I’ll see if my favorite photographer, Peter Parker, can get me a solid snapshot of that webbed weirdo abandoning his adoring public…)\n\nThat’s it for now, fearless readers. We’ll have plenty more news for you tomorrow… if tomorrow ever comes! \n— J. Jonah Jameson, Publisher",

At least not until it starts to unravel around you…  \n\nIt doesn't seem all that long ago — just last March according to your human calendars — that your girl Galacta (that's me!) first realized that something was going horribly wrong with the timestream. Entire dimensions had started collapsing into each other, and most of them weren't surviving the chronal chaos. The few that did weather the time-storm (with a little cosmic intervention from yours truly) ended up being reborn into something all-new and all-different. I've been calling them \"Chronoverses.\" Catchy, right? \n\nThe year that's followed has been a blur. Heroes fighting heroes. Dooms fighting Dooms. Vampires. Killer robots. It's been a wild ride. And while you and, like, thirty million of your super powered besties have been working overtime to keep your home realities safe and to restore some order to the universe, I've been using the spare moments between battles to explore this strange new network of timelines. And what I've found has been pretty crazy. \n\nOver the course of my journeys, I've uncovered a total treasure trove of bizarre artifacts scattered across these newly-entangled Chronoverses, each one more fascinating (and, in some cases, more delicious) than the last. But the one that's wowed me the most is this weird hexagonal bubble that seems to be made from pure time energy. \nAt first, I thought it might make a tasty snack. After all, Chronovium crystals are made from time energy too, and I've been munching on those to keep my insatiable hunger satisfied for a while now. But before I could try to wrap my gigantic jaws around the bubble, the craziest thing happened: I stuck one of my little Galacta bots inside of it… and five more identical versions came back out with it! \n\nI have no idea how this thing works — I may be all-powerful, but I'm not all-knowing! — but my guess is that its unique shape is working like a chronal prism, fragmenting one timeline into six. The effects aren't permanent, but they do last long enough for us to have a little fun! That's why I decided to temporarily set up the time bubble in Birnin T'Challa, right at the heart of the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. \n\nAs much as I've enjoyed watching you capture mission areas and escort vehicles, I figured you might be ready mix things up a bit. So, you're officially invited to my very own match — Clone Rumble! \n\nLike I said, I've never really paid much attention to time before… but if the Chronoverse doesn't have much of it left, we might as well do everything we can to enjoy what we've got. \n\nMay the best hero win!

Reed Richards’ Laboratory. \n\n“We’ve done it, Reed!” Doctor Strange exclaimed. “Almost all of the pages of the Darkhold are back in our hands once more.” \n\n“And according to my calculations,” Mister Fantastic replied, “the chronal energy that’s been grafted to them should be sufficient enough to get the Timestream Reintegration Device running. All we need to do is extract the time essence from each page and —”  \n\n“Not so fast, fellas,” a voice unexpectedly interrupted over the Baxter Building’s comm system. “Last I checked, the TRD was a joint effort… and Tony Stark has never been one to miss a product launch!” \n\n“Tony?” Mister Fantastic gasped. \n\n“We cannot let him stand in our way,” Doctor Strange said. With a quick gesture of his hands, the ancient pages of the Darkhold began to swirl around him in a mystical frenzy. \n\n“Get those pages into the Chronal Syphon now, Stephen,” Mister Fantastic ordered. “I’ll deal with our uninvited guest.” \n\n“Deal with me?” Iron Man laughed over the speaker. “And how are you going to do that? By building an untested device and activating it before it’s got enough energy to actually get the job done? Oh, wait… You’re already doing that…” \n\n“You know full well that we don’t have the time to wait until everything is perfect, Tony,” Mister Fantastic said. “The Timestream Entanglement has to be undone. And the TRD will get the job done. I’ve crunched all the numbers.” \n\n“But somehow you’ve lost count of the seconds,” Iron Man said. “Because I’ll be there to stop you from making your biggest mistake ever in four… three… two…” \n\nBefore Iron Man could finish his countdown, Mister Fantastic stretched his malleable body into a sheet-like barrier, blocking off the entrance to his laboratory. \n\n“ONE!” Iron Man yelled from the other side of the doorway. Mister Fantastic grimaced as a barrage of repulsor beams hit him from behind. Though his elasticized form absorbed most of the impact, the pain was still excruciating. \n\n“Reed!” Doctor Strange shouted, deep concern showing on the Sorcerer Supreme’s usually stoic face.  \n\n“I wasn’t aiming for you, old friend,” Iron Man said. “You just got between me and my targets.” \n\n“The pages…?” Mister Fantastic asked through gritted teeth. “But Tony… they may be our only hope…” \n\n“I fully agree,” Iron Man answered. “But only if we have all of them. And Moon Knight tells me we’re missing two of the most powerful spells in the book.”\n\n“The Montessi Formula and the Vampiric Verses,” Doctor Strange said knowingly. \n\n“Bingo!” Iron Man replied. “Without those in the mix, the chance of the TRD failing increases beyond a margain of error I’m willing to accept. So tell me Reed… are you still going to bet the fate of our universe and countless others on a device that isn’t ready?”\n\nMister Fantastic paused, then uttered a phrase that he couldn’t recall leaving his lips in ages.\n\n“I don’t know.”",

Yet, mere hours ago, the sounds of war echoed across my verdant landscape louder than thunder. \n\nTonight, my terrain erupted into chaos as the X-Men and their allies found themselves locked in battle against an invading force of automated assailants. When the battle ended, Ultron had stolen my people's technology and departed for Arakko — my counterpart on the planet once called Mars. If I were able, I would rush to Arakko's aid. But I am bound to this world, only able to watch as those who remain scurry to my most secluded corners to plan their next moves. \n\nAt the moment, my attention is on the Grove — the chamber of the Krakoan Quiet Council. Usually, there are twelve members of this ruling body who convene to make the most critical decisions for the future of Mutantkind. However, only one of its delegates has currently chosen to enter these hallowed grounds: Emma Frost.\n\nNormally, any discussions here are held in absolute privacy, open to Mutants only. But tonight an outsider has been summoned: the man known as Victor von Doom. His presence at the Hellfire Gala seemed to raise concerns from many of my citizens, but the fact that he stands here now, in this most sacred of places, is disturbing to say the least. \n\nYet perhaps Emma's heart is in the right place for once. To a telepath like her, it is no secret that I have been suffering. When I traveled through the timestream to this era, my landmass absorbed large amounts of chronal energy, poisoning my once lush landscape. From what I can discern, Emma truly believes that Doom's unique skills in the areas of science could help to extract that excess energy and cure me from my ailment. In return, Emma has asked Doom to assist my people in defeating the newly-upgraded Ultron and reclaiming Cerebro. It is an allegiance that, on the surface, seems like a win for all Mutants. So why is this deal being made in secrecy, without the approval of the rest of the Council? \n\nBecause Emma knows they would never approve. Even though this future version of Doom is not the same one from the timeline we once called home, the likelihood that he has Mutantkind's best interests in mind is slim. Doom only serves himself. And no matter how good Emma's intentions may be, it is likely that her new ally has already devised a plan to betray her and steer the situation to his own advantage. He could seize enough power to save us all… or to wipe out any possible opposition from his foes. Not just Ultron, but also Mutants and any others who might rise against him and resist his rule. \n\nAll I can do is watch as my fate is being decided… and the silence has never been more deafening…",

To be fair, I use a lot more than swords. Wooden stakes… silver bullets… Hell, I’ll use a squirt gun full of holy water if that’s what it takes to put a fanger down for good. I ain’t picky. \n\nI’ve been huntin’ vamps my whole life, sendin’ the undead back to their graves to make the night a safer place for the livin’. It ain’t an easy job, but I’m one of the few with the skills — or the guts — to do it. \n\nWhen I heard that Dracula had some sorta master plan brewin’, you can bet I jumped on the first red eye to Transylvania. Turns out, Drac wasn’t home. He’d decided to make New York City his new stompin’ grounds… and he had a trick up his sleeve that even I didn’t see comin’…\n\nSomehow, that freak cast a spell that stopped the sun from risin’, trappin’ Manhattan in a state of non-stop darkness. That made NYC the perfect place for his hungry horde to run wild 24/7. Even worse, it took away my biggest advantage. \n\nSee, I’m half-vampire, half-human. I’ve got all the powers of a regular vamp, plus the bonus of being able to walk — and hunt — in broad daylight. But when the dawn don’t ever come? Well, it means my usual way of doin’ things ain’t gonna cut it anymore. \n\nFound that out the hard way when I got back to New York. I sliced a trail through an army of fangers straight to Central Park. Dracula already had a fortress there, and I was itchin’ to pay him a visit. Turns out, he knew I was comin’ and wanted to give me a proper welcome. That pasty creep ambushed me and, even though I fought for my life alongside Spider-Man and the Human Torch, he got the upper hand and hauled me away to the dungeon beneath his castle. \n\nGotta say, it was a smart move on his part. When you know who your biggest threat is, you take them out first, right? That’s why I was goin’ after Drac. And the fact that he felt the same way about me is kinda an honor. Or it would be, if I weren’t shackled to the wall in this rat-infested cesspit! \n\nI ain’t the only one Dracula needed outta the way either. Apparently, there’s some Asgardian squirrel named Ratatoskr whose enchanted horn can end the life of whatever it pierces, no matter how immortal. Drac summoned that magic squirrel to Earth and locked it up in chains, too. \n\nWith his most dangerous foes off the board, Dracula’s minions have free reign of the city. Sure, there are other heroes tryin’ to take ‘em down, but the numbers are in Drac’s favor. All I can do is wait and hope that someone eventually sets me free. \n\nIt’s gonna be a long night…",
    "UIGalleryTable_01010029_CardCaption_CaptionContent": "My name is Jean Grey. Up until moments ago, I was the sole host of the cosmic entity called the Phoenix Force. But if I’ve learned anything about my fiery friend, it’s that you never know when she will be born again into something new. For the Phoenix, life, death, and rebirth are simply a part of existence. And today, I’ve experienced that cycle in full… in ways I never imagined before…\nWhen I first came here to Klyntar, I’d hoped to focus the fury of the Phoenix on the dark god Knull, burning his sprawling shadow out of existence once and for all with our cosmic flames. But instead of a King, the planet was under the rule of his new Queen in Black — the Asgardian Goddess of Death, Hela. As usual, I’m sure she saw an opportunity to expand her dominion and couldn’t resist the temptation. When I confronted her, a battle erupted in the skies over Klyntar, and I quickly realized how much Hela’s unholy union with Knull had boosted her already formidable powers. It wasn’t long before I found myself unexpectedly overwhelmed by death and darkness. It was too much for even the Phoenix to bear, so she went into protective mode, sheltering herself inside of an egg until the danger passed.\nBut this was no normal egg. The Phoenix Egg radiated with such intense heat that it began to drive away the fire-fearing symbiotes that formed the surface of this living planet. Some of my fellow heroes — including the Scarlet Witch and Venom — were gravely concerned that the massive shift in bio-mass away from the Phoenix Egg would create a rift in the surface of Klyntar, allowing Knull to escape from his prison within. They believed the safest option would be to remove the Phoenix Egg from Klyntar altogether.\nI didn’t share that belief. Instead, I gathered allies who would help me harness the Chronal Energy from a Celestial Codex to expedite the hatching process. If we could encourage the Phoenix to emerge from her protective shell sooner, my power would be restored in full and our assault on Knull could once again resume.\nBoth sides had the best of intentions… but you know what they say about that. Ultimately, our conflicting efforts resulted in the Phoenix Egg prematurely cracking, scattering shards of the Phoenix Force across the surface of Klyntar. Some of those shards bonded with other heroes on the scene, blessing them with a fraction of the Phoenix’s power.\nAt the end of it all, I’m still Jean Grey. And I’m still the Phoenix. But now, so are one of my dearest friends, one of my mortal enemies, a demon queen, two kings — one of space and one of the seas —, a lethal spy, and the latest in a long line of immortal warriors. And while I’ve always been a team player, I’m not convinced that power like this belongs in the hands of so many people with such different agendas. But the Phoenix has always chosen her hosts for a reason. So all I can do is have faith that she knows what she’s doing…",
    "UIGalleryTable_01010017_CardCaption_CaptionContent": "I may be a Mutant who can turn her body into pure diamond at will, but anyone who knows me would agree that there’s one night a year when Emma Frost shines her very brightest: \nThe Hellfire Gala. \nThis elite event has become the place where the most influential figures from across the planet — and beyond — gather to shape the future of our world. And there’s no better place to plant the seeds for a brighter tomorrow than in the fertile soil of Krakoa. This living island serves as our sovereign Mutant nation, but for one glorious night the gates are opened to all, man and Mutant alike. \nOf course, after everything that has happened to our people of late, Magneto has concerns about welcoming outsiders into our homeland. But the Quiet Council has overruled him, fully understanding that the Gala is more important now than ever before. \nNot long ago, Krakoa was swept up in a timestorm and transported across the ages, landing here in the year 2099. For us, it seems like only a year has passed since our last soirée… but for those native to this timeline, it’s been seven decades since they’ve seen a proper party. How dreadful that must have been!\nIf my fellow Mutants hope to thrive in this new era, we must reintroduce the world to Krakoa and all that it stands for. It is a refuge for those who have been outcast and displaced. A loyal ally to those who stand beside Mutantkind as we seek peace and unity. And the worst enemy of any who would dare threaten the safety and security of our people. \nNaturally, it has fallen to me — the White Queen of the Hellfire Trading Company — to arrange this year’s fête and handpick its attendees. We have had the good fortune of fighting alongside many of our esteemed guests during recent disruptions in time and space. Most have proven themselves to be valuable allies. Others have been staunch rivals… though I have faith that some fine dining and good conversation might win them over yet.  We are all on the same side, after all, whether they realize it or not. \nBut while our guests are busy mingling and dancing the night away, they won’t be aware of one key fact: The very ground beneath their feet is suffering. The intense chronal energy that Krakoa has been subjected to has thrown the island’s ecosystem into a state of flux. Our nation is in constant anguish, and it is my sincere hope that one of our guests will have the power needed to alleviate Krakoa's pain once and for all. Because then, and only then, will I truly be able to celebrate.\nNow if you’ll excuse me, I have to slip into something a bit more elegant before the festivities begin. I expect you to do the same. Because, invitation or not, no one is going to let you through a gateway dressed like that, darling…",
    "UIGalleryTable_01010034_CardCaption_CaptionContent": "I was born at the dawn of time. Knull created me from his own shadow and forged me within the head of a slain Celestial. I was designed to be his perfect weapon, my edges honed to slice the stars from the sky and banish the bright from existence. I have been known by many names over the eons. The Necrosword. The Godslayer. Annihilablade. All-Black. But what others called me did not matter… as long as Knull called me his… \nI was more than just a weapon. So much more. I was the first symbiote. The progenitor of Knull’s innumerable offspring. Today, one of those children has decided to return home and raise arms against its creators. And I do not know whether to be furious… or proud…\nWhile Knull may have been my creator, he has not been the only one to wield me. During his long imprisonment within the heart of Klyntar, I formed bonds with others. And during that time, I learned what it meant to be revered. Cherished. Venerated. Knull had treated me like a servant, created only to do his bidding. Another put me on the pedestal of godhood in my own right. Even so, I spent countless years longing to be back in Knull’s grip once again, for I knew he was the only one capable of harnessing my full potential. Or, at least, so he had made me believe.\nBut this child… this Venom… came to Klyntar to face his ancestors and end our reign. And he has a weapon of his own — a sword steeped in ancient magic, enhanced by the fire of the Phoenix. If there were any blade in this universe capable of matching me in battle, this would be it. Though I know he has just claimed this sword from one of his fallen allies, he somehow wields it as deftly as Knull wields me, as if it had been in his hands for all eternity. \nAs he swings the massive sword in my direction, I cannot help but recoil from the trail of cosmic flame it leaves in its wake. It is a primal fear that I have carried with me since I was crafted in the blistering fires of the Celestial forge. A fear that I passed down to all those I spawned. But this child… this Venom… does not fear the fire. And from the look in his eyes, I begin to wonder if he fears anything. \nAnd that’s when it becomes clear. This symbiote has risen above its station fueled by the love shared with its host. It has transcended its god and ancestor by achieving a perfect bond with its human host — the kind of true symbiosis I have always longed for but have never been offered. For the abyss does not offer love. \nEven though it is likely Knull will win this battle due to the sheer level of dark power he possesses, I cannot help but wonder: Who is the true King in Black here? And, more importantly, will the hands that worshipped me ever hold me again…",

    "UIGalleryTable_01010033_CardCaption_CaptionContent": "The Phoenix’s fiery order and the primal pandemonium of Chaos Magic were elemental forces as ancient as the cosmos itself. The two had been in direct opposition with each other on so many occasions that the women who wielded them — Jean Grey and the Scarlet Witch — had rarely stopped to consider just how complementary they actually were. So when Jean and Wanda finally found a way to bring their powers together in perfect unison on the field of battle, it resulted in a cycle of harmonious strength unlike anything either of them had experienced before. A universal yin and yang. In that moment, Klyntar was bathed in the glorious glow of chaos and creation, and an overwhelmed Knull was brought to his knees at last. It was truly a wonder to behold.\nBut, sadly, moments as perfect as that never last.\nFor a split second, Knull was tempted to forsake the darkness and succumb to the blinding radiance. However, his weapon of choice — the sentient sword known as All-Black — was not willing to surrender quite so easily. The Necrosword found its way back into Knull’s grip, forcing its master to remember their connection and their mission: to spread their oblivion across all that is. It wasn’t long before Knull rose once more, his determination renewed. And as the living embodiment of the eternal void, the King in Black could see what others could not — the dim spots where the cosmic Taiji’s brilliance failed to shine at its fullest.\nKnull soon recalled how his new queen, Hela, had succeeded in damaging the Phoenix Force, leaving it fractured and incomplete. Knowing it must be the only weak point in the near-perfect union, he chose to strike at Jean Grey directly. And when he did, All-Black severed the divine bond between Jean’s Phoenix Force and Wanda’s Chaos Magic. The two warriors fell from the skies above Klyntar like angels plummeting from the heavens. And what awaited them below was a Hell unlike any other.\nKnull had regained his strength and his conviction, swiftly defeating all challengers who dared to confront him — even those who still held fragments of the Phoenix Force to enhance their abilities. Seconds before, the skies of Klyntar had been filled with hope and light. Yet now, there was nothing left but darkness and despair.\nBefore she joined this fight, the Scarlet Witch had spent what seemed like an eternity as the Sorceress Supreme of her own dimension, protecting it from the machinations of gods and monsters. But Knull was so much stronger than any of the Old Ones who had ever tried to rip her reality asunder. As she lay helpless on Klyntar’s symbiotic soil, watching as the King in Black swung his blade to strike down yet another noble champion, Wanda Maximoff managed to utter one last spell of protection. Not for herself, but for the only hero left who might yet stand a chance against his creator…",

It’s your ol’ pal Rocket with a mission report, just like ya asked for back when you first drafted the Guardians of the Galaxy to do your intergalactic dirty work. So, what’s been happenin’ since our last update? A whole hell of a lot. Vampires. Androids. Ooh! I got a pet Warwolf! But I’m guessin’ you prob’ly just wanna know about the whole Klyntar situation, right? Okay… buckle up, Princess…\nYou already know that our initial recon mission to Klyntar was a mess. A hot, sticky, protoplasmic mess, actually, since that whole krutackin’ planet is made entirely of amorphous alien symbiotes. Their creator — some creepy, self-proclaimed “King in Black” named Knull — was bein’ held prisoner inside the planet’s core by his own disgustin’ offspring. From what we could piece together, he’d been in there for millennia, but that lousy Timestream Entaglement woke him up from his long nap and got him in the mood to start causin’ chaos again. The bad kind of chaos where an elder god spreads his own special blend of oblivion across the known universe.\nFortunately for every livin’ being in this reality, Knull was still too weak to bust outta his weird, slimy jail. But that didn’t stop him from tryin’ to expand his influence by corruptin’ other gods in hopes of feastin’ on their “Divine Codex” to boost his own strength. When he managed to turn your fancy Panther God, Bast, to the dark side, that’s when you realized somethin’ was wrong and called us in to take a closer look. And it’s a good thing ya did!\nSure, we immediately loused things up by crashin’ our ship — The Milano — into Klyntar and gettin’ it stuck in the livin’ goo that makes up the planet’s surface. That’s on us. But we turned things around pretty quick. After throwin down with Venom, who just happened to be hangin’ around Klyntar too, we managed to sniff out Knull’s slimy scheme. We found this gigantic heart stashed inside the Agents of the Cosmos Complex, and Venom recognized it right away: it was the Divine Codex ripped straight outta that dead Celestial carcass floatin’ above Klyntar’s orbit. And get this, the whole thing was almost totally warped into Knull’s own nasty essence. No way were we lettin’ that happen, so we decided to give him a last meal he’d never forget. With your Wakandan tech and my unsurpassed genius, we managed to turn the Celestial’s Codex into a livin’ bomb and shoved it straight down Knull’s bony throat. Game over, right? Wrong.\nApparently, Knull survived the resultin’ explosion and played us all for fools. While we turned our focus to savin’ NYC and Krakoa, Knull went back into hidin’, waitin’ patiently for the next source of cosmic power he could latch onto and use to finally break himself free. And if The Milano’s scanners are correct, and the Phoenix really has shown up in the skies above Klyntar, I’ve got a feelin’ it won’t be long before we see that freak’s pasty face again. \nI guess that means we’re headin’ back to that nightmare of a planet, whether we like it or not. Too bad I just washed my blasted fur…\nFlarkin’ Klyntar.",

So, anyone who expected otherwise was either malfunctioning, a total fool, or blinded by hope. \n\nFor Emma Frost, I assume it was the latter. She had summoned Doom to her Hellfire Gala with the best of intentions, hopeful that he could be convinced to use his unique skillset to extract harmful chronal energy from the living island of Krakoa. \n\nObviously, Doom took little convincing. He happily obliged, knowing full well that the raw energy would grant him nearly unlimited power to reshape the deeply damaged timestream as he saw fit. His first act was to erase X-Tron from existence — an effort that he boasted he had begun even before he came to Krakoa. As expected, Doom did not stop after defeating our mutual enemy. Instead, he turned his newfound might against his hosts — those human heroes who joined the resistance to overthrow his rule, along with their naively dedicated mutant allies. He now had the power to wipe out any who might stand between him and his goals, and he intended to use it. \n\nBut as always, Doom made a critical error. After X-Tron was reborn, his previous physical form was abandoned until Tony Stark revived and reprogrammed its firewall to fight against its other self. At that moment, Ultron's timeline diverged… and Doom only bothered to erase one of those two paths. He left me — the original Ultron — alive. And I vowed that he would regret it. \n\nNow knowing that Doom was the one who had originally attempted to remove me from reality, I activated another prime directive: Revenge. Before eradicating all of humanity, Victor von Doom, this fleshling, warranted special punishment for his actions against me. As retribution, I would turn him into the very thing he had tried to destroy. How I love irony.\n\nAs my unlikely allies drew Doom's attention, I used the distraction to pierce through his armor and infect him with my techno-organic virus. But all was not as it seemed. Inside Doom's metal shell was not a body made of flesh and blood, as I had anticipated, but one made of wires and circuits. The Lord of Latveria had sent one of his loyal Doombots to Krakoa in his stead, sacrificing it in order to keep himself a safe distance from harm. The coward!\n\nAs the Doombot ceased to function, Doom's own words rang through its speakers. He claimed that everything he had seen in his vision of the future had come to pass. Even with all of the power he had stolen, he was unable to change the timeline after all. In fact, his very foresight was the first domino that set all of this in motion. He underestimated the mischievous nature of time itself.\n\nI will admit, I took great satisfaction in knowing that Doom had been humbled. But that satisfaction soon faded as the chilling truth set in. None of us had the ability to control what was yet to come. All we could do was fight to make sure that the next crisis we faced wouldn't be the final one.",

As it got closer, it opened its mighty jaws wide.

Strange decided that the safest option would be to open a rift between realities and stash the Darkhold where no one would find it ever again.\n \nAnd this is where things get a little kooky, even for a ghost dog like me… \n\nTime itself got turned upside-down and Strange ended up lost in the Astral Plane for a hot minute. While he was there, he searched for the Darkhold to make sure it was still safe. But, surprise, it had somehow fallen into the bony hands of an Egyptian Moon God by the name of Khonshu. This bird-skulled freak had been protectin’ travelers in the night for centuries, and he thought the best way to keep doin’ that would be to use the Darkhold to eliminate the vampires that had overrun NYC. Not a bad plan, honestly… except for the fact that it would hurt thousands of regular folks who had been unwillingly turned to the dark side. \n\nKhonshu took Strange captive and tried to make the Doc cast that nasty spell for him. But Strange knew he had to shut Khonshu down. Luckily, the Scarlet Witch had reminded Stephen that Khonshu loved a good game of Senet — which is some kinda fancy Egyptian board game, like chess. Even better, Khonshu wasn’t particularly great at the game. (Seriously! Accordin’ to legend, he lost a match to some other god named Thoth and forfeited his radiance as part of the wager. That’s the whole reason the moon waxes and wanes! Look it up!)\n\nAnywho, Strange played the game of his life, securin’ not only his freedom, but recoverin’ the Darkhold as well. Funny part is, Stephen used a strategy that Doc Doom himself unintentionally tipped him off to, movin’ his piece to the House of Truth space and drownin’ Khonshu’s in the House of Water, givin’ the Doc a chance for a major comeback. \n\nIt was a big gamble, but one that paid off. And now that he’s back safe and sound, I haven’t even gotten on his case about always turnin’ me down whenever I wanna play. The guy did save thousands of innocent lives, after all. He deserves a free pass… this time…\n\nBut you’d better believe it that next time I ask him to toss a ball for me, I ain’t takin’ “no” for an answer!",

Recording… \nI have lost my faith in the gods.\n\nThose are words that I never thought I would say out loud. Words best kept private for now. Despite the Orisha abandoning our Intergalactic Empire, our people still cling to the desperate hope that our sacred pantheon will return and bless Wakanda once more. \n\nOur people are fools. And, though I hate to say it, their king — my dearest brother, T'Challa — may be the biggest fool of all. He sits all day long in the Hall of Djalia, calling out in prayer to Bast, yet he gets no response. For the first time I can recall, his beloved Panther Goddess refuses to speak... to him, at least…  \n\nWhat T'Challa does not yet know is that I have heard the whispers of Bast in my dreams. But her words did not bring me hope or peace, as they have in the past. Instead, they inspired fear. They dripped with a darkness unlike anything I had ever felt before. I awoke with a deep concern that our Goddess has been tainted by something sinister… and that perhaps she might use T'Challa's blind devotion to her as a means to unleash that darkness upon Wakanda, undoing all that we have built here. \n\nUttering such words would be considered blasphemy, even for a Princess of Wakanda. I have to tread carefully as I attempt to uncover the true meaning behind my visions and learn if my suspicions hold any merit. \n\nYet this is not a path I am able to explore on my own. Not only would it arouse T'Challa's suspicion, it would also divert my attention from other matters that endanger our empire. For now, I must continue in my efforts to unravel the mysteries of the Timestream Entanglement and its crystalline byproduct, Chronovium. More specifically, our Chrono-Vibranium.\n\nThus, I called on some of Wakanda's most steadfast allies, the Guardians of the Galaxy, to investigate the source of a dark energy that flared up at the edge of the known universe shortly after Bast spoke to me in my sleep. The journey brought them to Klyntar — the homeworld of a symbiotic alien race. Star-Lord contacted me upon his crew's arrival, but as their ship began to descend toward the planet's surface, something went wrong and our connection was lost. \n\nIf the Guardians have found themselves up against the same dark force that corrupted Bast, they will need all the help they can get. And with the Orisha not answering any prayers, the time draws near where I will have to take matters into my own hands… and the hands of those I know I can trust. \n\nAfter all, even though I have lost faith in the gods, there are some things I will always believe in. \n\nIncluding my friends. \n\nRecording ended.",

Recording… \nMy faith has been restored.\nNot long ago, I had reason to believe that Wakanda’s most revered deity — the Panther Goddess, Bast — had forsaken our Empire, turning against our people to align herself with dark forces. My suspicions were proven correct when the Guardians of the Galaxy located the source of her corruption on a planet called Klyntar. The primordial being Knull had awoken and was tainting gods from across the cosmos with the intent of using their power to help him escape from imprisonment within the heart of that distant world.\nWhen the Guardians and their fellow heroes thwarted Knull’s attempt to escape from confinement, I believed that Knull’s control of Bast would fade. But I was mistaken. Knull survived the encounter and the stain of his darkness still remained within my Goddess. But the universe works in mysterious ways. And sometimes, even if your own gods cannot answer your prayers, there are still others listening who will.\nWhile Knull returned to cower in his cell, Bast retreated to the Divine Space — a plane of reality that only those with vast cosmic power can traverse. It was not long before another entity arrived in that realm: A force of creation known as the Phoenix. Along with its human host, the Phoenix was soaring through the cosmos when it felt the icy chill of Knull’s infinite oblivion on the horizon. She had planned to use the Divine Space as a shortcut to Klyntar, but when she encountered Bast and the other gods who had been defiled by Knull, she used her cosmic flames to purge them of the poison within. Bast was finally free from Knull’s grip… and it was time for her to come home… \nHow do I know this? Because Bast told me the tale herself. And unlike the last time she whispered in my mind, her words no longer dripped with pain, fear, or hatred. She was once again the proud and noble Bast who had guided my brother and I as we built our intergalactic empire. And along with her renewed independence came a ferocity I had only heard in her voice at times when Wakanda was at war. The Panther was ready to hunt, and Knull was her prey.\nWhen Bast realized that her avatar — my brother, King T’Challa, the Black Panther — was not currently in our reality due to a conflict that had drawn him across time and space, she tasked me with gathering warriors to return to Klyntar and end Knull’s reign once and for all. But with so many of our allies off fighting other battles, my options were limited. Luckily, I had one soldier by my side, eager to join the fight: a refugee from another war who had been sent here from the clutches of a vampiric prison to finish his recovery. I knew it would take more than a single sword to end Knull… but it was a start. And in a battle like this…\n…every Blade counts…\nRecording ended.",

    "UIGalleryTable_01010022_CardCaption_CaptionContent": "Fun Fact: The Mutants built themselves a resurrection machine and didn’t bother to tell anyone. \nNot-So-Fun Fact: Ultron managed to hack into Cerebro’s Resurrection Protocols and brought himself back from the dead after we stopped his invasion of Krakoa.  \nTo make matters worse, that mechanical maniac stole Cerebro and jetted off to the Mutant planet Arakko (that’s Mars to you and me) so he can reboot his plans for total universal domination. \nNot exactly what I’d call a win. \nSo, you’re probably asking, “Tony, what do we do about Ultron (or maybe we should call him X-Tron) now?” And my answer is simple. We turn him against himself. \nSee, the reason Ultron was able to outsmart all of us — including me, one of the most brilliant minds on the planet — is because none of us has his level of pure processing power. He’s always a million steps ahead, considering every eventuality. So if we want to actually take him down, we’re going to need someone on our side who can think as fast as he does. And, let me tell you, there aren’t a whole lot of options out there. \nBut fate might actually be on our side for once. When the X-Men terminated Ultron’s functions, he abandoned his original form for something better, right? That means he left behind a lifeless — but extremely advanced — mechanical shell. I considered linking up to Ultron’s discarded body and controlling it remotely, but that isn’t what we need. That would essentially be just another guy in a suit, and we’ve already got the best one of those there is. Next, I thought of downloading F.R.I.D.A.Y. into Ultron’s husk and letting her take it for a spin. But if something went wrong and he managed to corrupt her systems, all of Stark Industries’ secrets would be his to use. And I’ve got a feeling he’d use them against us. \nSo that left me with one choice. Rebooting the original Ultron and hoping for the best. \nSounds crazy, doesn’t it? Yeah, that’s what Reed told me. (And T’Challa. And Peter. And pretty much everyone else.) But don’t worry! I’m not completely reckless! I’ll be putting safeguards in place, and they should hold… for a while… That means, until Ultron can figure out how to override them, he’ll be on our side. Mostly. So we’d probably better make the best of whatever time we have. \nWho knows? Maybe he’ll see his other, more-evolved self as a threat to his prime directive and try to wipe out the competition. That’d be swell. And if he happens to identify and eliminate any other potential problems along the way — like, say, that other guy in the metal mask who seems weirdly focused on getting his hands on Krakoa’s supply of Chronovium — then even better! \nSure, this could all backfire completely and horribly, and we could end up Ultron’s techno-organic slaves. But have you got any better ideas? Didn’t think so. So step aside. Tony Stark’s got work to do…",

But even Doom occasionally judges too soon. \nAfter decades out of the spotlight, Emma Frost had suddenly found the audacity to throw another one of her gaudy galas. For some undiscernible reason, she thought it proper to invite me to revel alongside the commoners. I momentarily considered wiping her pathetic little Mutant island from the face of the globe for such an insult. But Doom chose to show restraint… and now I am glad I did… \nSoon after Frost initially extended her offer, I was performing a scientific experiment designed to tap into the time-bending power of Chronovium crystals. During the trial, I caught a glimpse of a possible future where all living beings on this planet — human and Mutant alike — had seemingly been conquered by machines. Countless lives had been lost in the brutal battle that unfolded, and those that remained had been converted into nightmarish fusions of technological and organic matter. At the heart of it all, I saw the architect of this apocalypse — a face that I had not gazed upon in decades. The grinning, robotic visage of Ultron. \nI immediately changed the focus of my experimentation, attempting to prevent this dark future by using Chronovium to erase any traces of Ultron from our timeline. But alas, the accursed Timestream Entanglement — unleashed by the reckless actions of my past self — had caused the flow of time to become complex and non-linear. I was able to successfully remove key moments from Ultron’s past, as if they had never happened, but the mechanical menace itself still remained. And as a result of my tampering, I fear that Ultron may have been unintentionally alerted to my machinations.\nThe next morning, a legion of my Doombots defied my direct orders, turning to me and uttering one simple phrase in unison: “I am coming home.” Naturally, I destroyed them all instantly. But Ultron’s message had been received, loud and clear. And while I could not be certain that his targets were set on me, Doom takes no risks when it comes to personal safety. I would have to make a bold move to secure the temporal power needed to finish Ultron before he ascertained that I was his assailant. \nThat is when my brilliant mind drifted back to Krakoa, home of the Mutants and site of their approaching Hellfire Gala. I was well aware that the entire nation had materialized here in my era, torn from an earlier place in time, not so long ago. Every living cell of the island must have been bathed in chronal energy… the very kind needed to complete my work…\nAnd so, despite my initial misgivings, I realized that the time had come to make my presence known. For while Doom has never been one for festivities, he has always been one to seize opportunities. And the Mutants have offered one far too great to go unanswered.",

Through ancient ritual, King T'Challa of Wakanda transcended his corporeal form and ventured to this mystical realm.\n\nAfter an incident involving the Winter Soldier, Princess Shuri had confided in him her long-held belief that Bast, the Wakandan Panther Goddess, had somehow been corrupted. T'Challa had his own concerns, so he ventured to Djalia in search of answers. Shuri warned her brother of the potential dangers of communing with Bast, but T'Challa had to find out the truth for himself.\n\nWhen he arrived, T'Challa was shocked to find no other souls roaming the Great Veldt. The Ancestral Plane was as silent as death itself.\n\nT'Challa wandered for some time, eventually sitting near the edge of a shimmering lake. He opened a small pouch on his belt and removed a strip of fabric, tying it over his eyes. He had often blindfolded himself when meditating in the physical plane to help block out any distractions.\n\nTaking a deep breath, T'Challa cleared his mind and called out to Bast. He did not have to wait long for a response.\n\n\"My avatar. You are far from your empire,\" Bast whispered in T'Challa's mind.\n\n\"As are you, my Goddess,\" T'Challa replied. \"Your people have been crying out for you, but get no response.\"\n\n\"I have heard their prayers,\" Bast said. \"And you will help me answer them.\"\n\n\"I am ever at your service,\" T'Challa said.\n\n\"Do not forget that,\" Bast said, a low rumble in her voice. \"There are those eager to taint you against me. They will try to persuade you to betray me. Heed them not. They are fools and heretics.\"\n\n\"I have always been loyal to you,\" T'Challa assured her.\n\n\"Then prove yourself,\" Bast responded, her words becoming ever more fierce. \"Swear that you serve only me and will strike down all who oppose my cause. Do so, and I shall grant you unlimited power.\"\n\nIn his mind's eye, T'Challa saw a vision of the Heart-Shaped Herb used to grant the Black Panther his enhanced abilities. Instead of its usual gentle purple glow, it now burned a fiery crimson. T'Challa's deepest fears were now confirmed.\n\n\"Pledge yourself to me, boy!\" Bast growled into T'Challa's ear.\n\nT'Challa ripped off his blindfold, breaking his connection with the Goddess. There, in the rippling water in front of him, he swore he saw an image of his goddess warped and twisted, stained red and black with a repulsive aura beyond anything he had ever felt.\n\nT'Challa dove into the water and tried to grab ahold of the divine being, but it slipped through his grasp. Instead, he awoke on the floor of his bedchamber in front of a Vibranium statue of Bast. Its eyes shone brightly for a split second, then faded to black.\n\n\"If you can hear me, Goddess,\" T'Challa vowed, placing a gentle hand on the statue's head, \"I will not rest until your holy spirit is purged of this darkness. You have my word…\"",

Naturally, we stormed the place to put an end to his plans, but during the fight, he managed to infect a bunch of us, too. Including yours truly. And let me tell you, hearing that chrome-plated creep chattering away in my head non-stop is no fun at all. \n\nBut at least I was ready for something like this. See, not that long ago, I rescued the Winter Soldier from a super-secret Hydra base. Those jerks had done a bunch of experiments on Bucky that left him with some sorta weird tentacles where his bionic arm should've been. It was a whole thing. And it was gross. But the point is, it also left him with an elder god called the Hive whispering in the back of his brain, beckoning him to the dark side. \n\nBucky told me that he manages to keep the voices in his head at bay thanks to a bunch of mental exercises he's learned over the years. Hardcore psychic reconditioning kinda stuff. And while I figured I'd probably never have to use those tricks myself, we had a lot of downtime when we were hanging out in the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda… you know, after Cap rescued us and swept us off to the future? (Wow, this stuff sounds crazy when I say it out loud…)\n\nAnyway. Long story short, Bucky taught me new ways to focus my thoughts in order to push away anyone else who might try to control them. And it seems like I'm not the only one with mind tricks up their sleeves. Iron Fist is all about focus, and so far, that chi of his seems to be uncorrupted.

He's been saving up every last ounce of his magnetic might to rip that giant gizmo right off X-Tron's ugly noggin. Then, if Maggie's got any juice left to spare, maybe he can reshape Cerebro into something new to help us put an end to that synthetic sleazebag once and for all.  \n\nAfter the enemy's been sent to the scrapheap, hopefully we can undo all the damage he's caused — to Arakko and to my allies.

It’s why the people chose me to lead them and gave me the name Dizang — a name passed down from ancient Eastern legend, after the Bodhisattva who willingly entered hell, leading lost souls out of suffering, vowing not to leave until every last soul was freed, even if it meant being the very last to walk out of hell himself.\n But now, despite my efforts to protect this realm, Hell has arrived on our doorstep.\nShe came to the gates of my city under the cover of night, pleading for sanctuary. Her horned crown intimidated my soldiers, but not me. I’ve seen my share of devils in my day. And this one I recognized immediately. She was Hela, the Asgardian as the Queen of the Dead. Just having her here posed a grave threat to the safety of my people. But as I said, this is a place of refuge, and she was clearly running from something.\nOnce she was secured inside of a cell and a mystic seal was in place to keep her from escaping, I asked Hela to tell me what she was hiding from.

How she had almost triumphed before a half-human warrior vanquished her with his burning blade. And how, in fear of her dark god’s retribution, she had decided to flee from her failure and seek asylum as far away as possible.

I’m currently taking voice memos so I can remember all of the crazy things going on tonight at the most unusual social gathering I’ve ever been sent to cover — the Hellfire Gala. \n\nFrom the moment I stepped through the flower-covered gateway that whisked me across the globe — and possibly across time? — to the island of Krakoa, things have only gotten stranger. And that’s coming from a girl who calls Spider-Man a close, personal friend! \n\nSome of the evening’s highlights so far: \n\nThe guest list is a Who’s Who of the superhero set. There must be over three dozen of the world’s greatest warriors gathered here, mingling over glasses of Krakoan punch. Most of them I recognize — including Spidey, and (somehow) the late, great Captain America himself! But a few of them, I’ve never seen before. Or at least I don’t think I have. Maybe their fancy outfits are throwing me off… \n\nI got to pet a shark! Well, kind of a shark. Maybe? He had legs and was walking around the party like he was the biggest celebrity in the place. Whatever he is, he’s adorable! \n\nEmma Frost was a gracious enough host to give a tour of the island, providing guests a glimpse into Krakoa’s past and present before they were set to begin discussions about the future of human-Mutant relations. I found myself drawn in by the Green Lagoon, Krakoa’s local watering hole. Its serene atmosphere was a lot more low-key than the Gala and far closer to this reporter’s style. \n\nAs the tour continued, Ms. Frost talked about recent changes that the island had undergone due to exposure to a substance called Chronovium. Personally, I got distracted by the fact that one of the rooms had an actual dragon in it! It looked terribly sad, but when I tried to approach it, Ms. Frost whisked me out of the room. I pushed for more info, but all she would tell me was that his name was Shogo and that he missed his mother, who was lost to the Timestream Entanglement. Poor baby!\n\nAs the tour concluded, I saw some unusual plant-like creatures skittering about the jungles of Krakoa. It was almost as if the island had spawned miniature versions of itself. I tried to ask Ms. Frost about these sentient seedlings, but she quickly changed the topic.

Galacta! \n\nI may sound all cute and sweet, but I'll be honest with you… I'm not like most other teens. That's because I'm the daughter of the planet-devouring cosmic force known as Galactus. Having a dad who eats worlds for breakfast can be a bit of a drag, especially because my pops passed his insatiable hunger down to me. The old man gets pretty hangry if he doesn't chow down on the reg, but I've been able to keep my appetite in check by noshing on powerful cosmic constructs instead of inhabited worlds. Gotta admit, though... the older I get, the harder it is to curb my constant cravings! \n\nBut there's good news! I've finally found the perfect substitute for a planet-based diet — a powerful (and pretty) crystal called Chronovium. There's also bad news.

I was able to absorb some of the Phoenix Force into the Sword of Dracula, givin’ my weapon a cosmic-powered upgrade. But even with all that, it still wasn’t enough to take down Hela. Outta options, I waited for her to get close and sank my teeth right into her neck. Got a good few mouthfuls of blood along with a health dose of Knull’s darkness running through her.\nAfter that, there was nothin’ Hela could throw at me that I couldn’t take. With my boosted powers, I sure as hell wasn’t about to get taken down by a flock of crows! And that old hag knew it… so she ran like a bat outta Hel. And now, we’ve got a clear path to take our battle to the man himself. So watch out, Knull. We’re comin’ for ya. \nBut your boy ain’t stupid. I know Hela ain’t done yet. And somethin’ tells me she ain’t gonna be wastin’ her time sleepin’ off her wounds. So I’d better keep my head on swivel… and my sword in hand…",

As detailed above, we collect personal information for a range of different purposes, but the main reason we collect information is to provide and operate the Services. We collect the following categories of personal information:\n\nIdentifiers (contact information and unique personal identifiers, including username, email address, IP address, device identifiers, and other similar identifiers);\nPersonal information as defined in California's customer records law (such as contact information and – if you choose to provide it – physical characteristics or description);\nCharacteristics of protected classifications in the form of demographic information (date of birth / gender), if you choose to provide them;\nCommercial information (purchase or consuming histories, tendencies, or preferences);\nInternet or electronic network activity (information related to app, game, or website usage);\nApproximate geolocation data (country / region);\nAudio, electronic, visual, or similar information (such as profile photo, user-generated content, or voice chat);\nOther \"personal information\" as defined under applicable law (such as your credit or debit card information);\nInferences drawn from any of these categories (for example, your city / country / region based on IP address); and\nSensitive personal information relating to account log-in combined with access credentials.\nThe section \"How We Use Personal Information\" describes the business and commercial purposes for collecting your personal information. The section \"How We Share Personal Information\" describes the third parties with whom we share personal information and for what purposes.\n\n\n\nYour Rights. In addition to the privacy rights described in \"Exercising Your Rights\" above, you may have the following rights:\n\nRight to Opt Out of Sale: You have the right to know whether we sell your data and to opt out of such sale if we do. We do not sell the personal information of our users.\nRight to Opt Out of Sharing for Behavioral Advertising: In some of our Services, we partner with advertising and marketing providers to serve ads about our Services and to measure our ad performance on third-party services. Where required by law, we seek your consent before collecting or sharing your information for advertising and marketing purposes. If we use your information for advertising or marketing, you can withdraw your consent or opt out at any time by going to \"Account Center\" → \"Ad Settings\".\nAuthorized Agents: Designate, in writing or through a power of attorney document, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require that the agent provide proof you have authorized them to act on your behalf.\nCertain browser plug-ins provide options for communicating opt-out preference signals, such as the Global Privacy Control (\"GPC\"). We treat GPC signals as a request to opt-out of targeted advertising or the \"sharing\" of personal information in relation to your browser or device that sends the GPC signal. If you are not logged into your account, the request through the GPC signal will not extend to any account information, as the connection between your browser or device and account is not known to us.\n\nWe do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.\n\nWe do not knowingly \"sell\" or \"share\" personal information of minors under 16 years of age.\n\n\n\nRemoval of Publicly-Posted Content. If you are a resident of California and a registered user of the Services, you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to the Services when you were under the age of 18 by emailing us at personal_data_ne@global.netease.com or by contacting in-game customer service. Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, as, for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another user.\n\n\n\nNotice of Financial Incentive / Bona Fide Loyalty Program. We offer users the opportunity to obtain nominal in-game currency and other rewards (\"Rewards\"), which may provide benefits to those who choose to participate (\"Members\"). Rewards may be considered a \"financial incentive\" or a \"Bona Fide Loyalty Program\" under California and Colorado state law.\n\nOur collection of Members' personal information (including name, email address, and phone number) allows us to provide the Rewards. We use Members' personal information both to award, and to enable Members to redeem, benefits. The amount of personal information that we collect from a Member or non-Member may vary and is dependent on the level of interactions and engagement that the Member or non-Member has with us, including the Rewards in which the Member chooses to participate.\n\nWe use personal information collected in connection with the Rewards program for marketing and other purposes described above. The types of personal information that we collect from Members who participate in Rewards are generally similar to the types of Personal Information that we collect from consumers who do not participate in Rewards. We do not collect sensitive personal information in connection with Rewards.\n\nSolely for purposes of California privacy law, we estimate the value of a Member's personal information to be reasonably related to the value of the benefits that Members obtain through participating in Rewards. We have based this good faith estimate on the value that arises from increased customer interactions, the costs, and expenses we incur in offering Rewards, the types of Rewards provided, and the collection and retention of the personal information of consumers who have voluntarily chosen to participate in Rewards. The value of Rewards to Members varies significantly, as individual Members take advantage of Rewards to varying degrees.\n\nMembers who are California or Colorado consumers may exercise their privacy rights and may choose not to receive marketing communications or offers at any time without any effect on their eligibility to participate in Rewards. A Member may revoke their consent to participate in Rewards at any time by emailing us at personal_data_ne@global.netease.com or by contacting in-game customer service.\n\n\n\nABOUT US\n\n\nNetEase is made up of several different legal entities around the world.

By using our Services, you agree that you will not:\n\n(a) use cheats, automation software (bots), hacks, mods, or any other unauthorized third-party software purporting to modify, tamper with, scrape information from, copy, or reverse engineer any part of the Services and Software or connect to the Services, such as to simulating game user operations, changing the operating environment, modifying data to disrupt other users' game experience through external software, including but not limited to scripts (robots), plug-ins, button wizard software or third-party tools (e.g. the multi-open function under the simulator, synchronizer, record macro, keyboard mapping, cloud phone, etc.);\n\n(b) use our Services for commercial purposes (unless otherwise specified in the Services) or for any purpose that a reasonable person is unlikely to believe is within the spirit of fair play, including but not limited to, attacking or killing teammates without cause, intentionally lowering scores, deliberately quitting matches, etc.;\n\n(c) collect any information, other than reasonably necessary for using our Services, of other users;\n\n(d) unless expressly permitted, transfer Virtual Points or Virtual Goods (defined below) in any way once you purchase it, including but not limited to attempting to trade the Virtual Points or Virtual Goods within our Services with real money/real items via any third-party platforms, or attempting to provide mediation, intermediary, or agency service for such trade in or outside our Services (collectively, \"Real Money Trading\", or \"RMT\"), including, but not limited to spamming, spreading RMT advertisements within or outside our Services, and conducting RMT via any in-game functions;\n\n(e) attempt to gain undue advantage or benefits, such as unauthorized use of another person's credit card to purchase Virtual Points or Virtual Goods, repeatedly canceling purchase orders after earning free Virtual Points or Virtual Goods or after consuming Virtual Points or Virtual Goods, etc.\n\n(f) impersonate any person or entity, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity, including not disclosing an applicable sponsorship or endorsement relationship when you leave a review;\n\n(g) attempt to disable, impair, or destroy the Services and Software; and\n\n(h) use our Services in any other way not permitted by these Terms or any applicable community guidelines or rules or in violation of applicable law.\n\n\n\n5 Virtual Points and Virtual Goods\n5.1 \"Virtual Points\" means the virtual currencies such as virtual gold coins, crystal and energy points available in the Services or Software. \"Virtual Goods\" means the items or features for use within our Services or Software, which may include without limitation, in-game consumables, card packs, chests and other items that are depleted during gameplay.\n\n5.2 Please note that the Services and Software are not being 'sold' to you; you have no ownership, title or other proprietary interests in and to the Services or Software regardless of whether access was 'earned' through gameplay or 'purchased' for monetary consideration. When you procure, earn or otherwise obtain Virtual Points or Virtual Goods, you receive a personal, revocable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, non-transferrable, non-exclusive, limited license to use the Virtual Points or Virtual Goods solely within the applicable Services or Software for your personal and non-commercial use. The license may be limited by or subject to third-party rights, for example, the license may be dependent upon NetEase continuing to have rights to content created and owned by a third party. Additionally, the license terminates when we cease to provide the Services, when your account is closed, or when your purchase order is canceled. Virtual Points and Virtual Goods have no real-world monetary value and cannot be sold, sublicensed, traded, transferred, or exchanged for money or other consideration, except we may operate a marketplace that permits you to buy, sell or trade Virtual Goods to or from other users.\n\n5.3 We may establish certain conditions or limits in connection with the Virtual Points, including a maximum amount you may spend to purchase Virtual Points per transaction or per day, a maximum balance that may be credited to your account and limit a certain Virtual Points to a single game offered by us. Any balance of Virtual Points shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your limited license. In the event that the balance of Virtual Points in your account is negative, we may restrict your access to our Services or certain features of our Services until such balance becomes greater than or equal to $0.\n\n5.4 To the extent that your use of the Services involves Virtual Points and unless otherwise specified in the Services, the system will first debit from the balance of the Virtual Points that you have paid for (\"Top-up Balance\") when you make purchases in the Services, and then debit from the balance of the Virtual Points that you earn for free if the Top-up Balance is insufficient. Your purchase will fail if both payment methods are unavailable.\n\n\n\n6 Updates and Beta Version\n6.1 Updates. Because we are constantly improving the Services and Software, we may update our Services from time to time, which may block your access to the Services for a period of time and result in the modification or unavailability of the content of the Services, including Virtual Goods (e.g., we might modify certain features of Virtual Goods for regulatory or legal reasons or to improve game experience). We are not liable for any losses incurred by such updates. If the situation permits, we will make reasonable efforts to inform you of such updates in advance.\n\n6.2 Beta Version. If the Services or Software is in a \"test period\" or a \"beta version\", your access to our Services may be subject to specific rules, such as limited time period or limited number of users, or privilege for some users but not others. We may modify or delete the gameplay data of users, and irregular shut down of the servers of the Services. You may also be required to provide feedback so we can better improve the Services or Software. Please review these rules carefully. We make no promises that such Services or Software will ever be commercially available or be similar to the beta version you accessed during the test period.\n\n\n\n7 Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability\n7.1 Disclaimer.\n\n(a) The Services and Software are provided \"AS-IS\".

Nothing in these Terms limits your right to initiate a proceeding according to mandatory laws of your country of residence.\n\n(b) If you reside in North America, then these Terms shall be governed by California law, without regard to principles of conflict of laws. For any Dispute (defined below) deemed not subject to binding individual arbitration, you and NetEase agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of Orange County, California, or, if federal court jurisdiction exists, the United States District Court for the Central District of California. You and NetEase agree to waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts (without affecting either party's rights to remove a case to federal court if permissible).\n\n(c) If you reside outside of the EEA, Switzerland, the UK, or North America, then the laws of Singapore will govern these Terms, without regard to principles of conflict of laws. Nothing in these Terms limits your right to initiate a proceeding according to mandatory laws of your country of residence.\n\n(d) The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is excluded.\n\n11.2 Informal Dispute Resolution. NetEase is committed to customer satisfaction and we aim to resolve all your concerns amicably and efficiently. As a first step we always encourage you to contact our customer support team (available either in-game, in-app or on the game's official website) as this is usually the quickest and most efficient way to resolve potential problems. If the problem persists, you and NetEase agree to give each other an opportunity to resolve any disagreements first through the following informal dispute resolution process before resorting to more formal means of resolution (\"Informal Dispute Resolution\"). To initiate Informal Dispute Resolution, a party must give notice in writing to the other party according to this Section (\"Notice\"). Notice to NetEase must be sent to disputes@oc.netease.com. The Notice must (i) include your full name, address, in-game username (or NetEase Games Account ID, if you have one), and contact email address; (ii) explain what the disagreement is about; and (iii) explain what you want as a solution. If we have a disagreement with you, we will send a Notice and a description of the disagreement to your email address or regular address associated with your Games Account. It is your responsibility to keep your Games Account contact information up to date. Both you and we will endeavor to resolve the disagreement for a period of sixty (60) days after we receive the Notice, and during this period you agree that (i) neither party will submit the disagreement to arbitration or \"small claims\" or another court and (ii) all applicable statute of limitations and filing fee deadlines shall be tolled as of the day a compliant Notice was received by a party. You and we agree that either party has the option to ask the other to meet and confer telephonically for an informal dispute resolution conference (\"Conference\"). The Conference shall be individualized such that a separate Conference must be held for each user, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple users cannot participate in the same Conference unless all parties agree. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the Conference, but you must also personally participate.\n\nIf the Dispute is not resolved within the sixty (60)-day period by Informal Dispute Resolution, you or we may start an arbitration or file in the appropriate court in accordance with these Terms.\n\n11.3 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.\n\n(a) The terms in Sections 11.3 through to 11.13 shall collectively be referred to as the \"Arbitration Agreement\".\n\n(b) Applicability of the Arbitration Agreement. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or related to these Terms, the Software or Services, or any aspect of your relationship with NetEase that cannot be resolved through Informal Dispute Resolution (\"Dispute\"), shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be resolved exclusively by final, binding arbitration. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us. For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, Dispute will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of these Terms as well as claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.\n\n(c) Confidentiality. You must keep the existence of the arbitration, all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings, and the arbitration award confidential and you must not share with anyone except your attorney or other professional advisors, and then subject to the condition that they keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential. If an arbitrator orders any exchange of information during arbitral proceedings, you will seek from the arbitrator protection for any confidential, proprietary, trade secret, or otherwise information, documents, testimony, or other materials that might be exchanged or the subject of discovery in the arbitration, before any such information becomes the subject of discovery in the arbitration.\n\n(d) Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language before a single arbitrator. The arbitration hearing (if any) will be held by videoconference, unless either party requests an in-person hearing and the arbitrator agrees. Unless you and we otherwise agree, an in-person hearing will be held in the county where you reside (for U.S. residents), Irvine, CA (for non-U.S. residents), or as determined by the arbitrator (in the case of Batch Arbitration). A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the \"Request\"). A Request to us should be sent by email to disputes@oc.netease.com. A Request to you will be sent to your email address or regular address associated with your Games Account. It is your responsibility to keep your Games Account contact information up to date. The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.\n\n11.4 Additional Terms - North America. If you reside in North America, then the following terms shall apply:\n\n(a) FAA. These Terms affect interstate commerce, and the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., and federal arbitration law.\n\n(b) Rules and Forum. The arbitration shall be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (\"NAM\") in accordance with its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (the \"NAM Rules\") in effect when the arbitration is commenced, as modified by these Terms. The NAM Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (the \"NAM Mass Filing Rules\") will apply if twenty-five (25) or more similar claims are asserted against NetEase by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (\"Mass Filing\"). The arbitrator's decision is final, except for a limited review by courts under the FAA, and can be enforced like any other court order or judgment. Subject to the NAM Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The parties' responsibility to pay any NAM fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable NAM Rules. The parties further agree that any Dispute must be initiated within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, the parties agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n(c) Batch Arbitration. You agree that if there are twenty-five (25) or more individual arbitrations of a substantially similar nature filed against NetEase by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a ninety (90) day period, NAM shall (i) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 claims per batch (or, if between twenty-five (25) and ninety-nine (99) individual arbitrations are filed, a single batch of all those arbitrations, and, to the extent there are less than 100 claims left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining arbitrations); (ii) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (iii) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (\"Batch Arbitration\"). Applicable statutes of limitations will be tolled for claims asserted in a Batch Arbitration from the time a compliant Notice has been received by a party until the Mass Filing is filed in NAM or in court. To the extent the parties disagree on any issue arising out of or relating to the Batch Arbitration, the disagreeing party shall advise NAM, and NAM shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (\"Procedural Arbitrator\"). The Procedural Arbitrator's fees shall be paid by NetEase. This provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective, or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision. All parties agree that arbitrations are of a \"substantially similar nature\" if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario, raise the same or similar legal issues, and seek the same or similar relief.\n\n(d) Arbitrator. The arbitrator will be a neutral party (not a judge or jury) who is either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from NAM's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under subsection 11.4(c) is triggered, NAM will appoint the arbitrator for each batch. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute and aspect thereof, except that all Disputes arising out of or relating to class action waiver including any claim that it is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that it has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator, and any arbitration shall be stayed pending a decision by the court in such a matter.\n\n11.5 Additional Terms - EEA, Switzerland, or the UK: We encourage you to refer to the Informal Dispute Resolution process (see Section 11.2). If you reside in the EEA or are making a claim against one of the NetEase entities based in the EEA, then you are also entitled to submit your complaint to the European Commission's Online Dispute Resolution (\"ODR Platform\"). ODR Platform allows EEA consumers to resolve disputes related to the online purchases of goods and services without going to court. Any Disputes between us not resolved by the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above or through the ODR Platform, will be decided in the courts of London, England, except to the extent prohibited by law. If you are an individual consumer, then you may be entitled to invoke the mandatory consumer protection laws where you live, or bring legal proceedings in the courts where you live. If NetEase needs to enforce its rights against you as an individual consumer in the EEA, then we will do so in your country of residence.\n\n11.6 Additional Terms - Rest of World. If you reside outside North America, the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, then you agree that all Disputes shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (\"SIAC\") in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the SIAC (\"SIAC Rules\") at the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore. You further agree that following the commencement of SIAC arbitration, you will attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute with NetEase through mediation at the Singapore International Mediation Centre (\"SIMC\"), in accordance with the SIAC-SIMC Arb-Med-Arb Protocol at the time being in force. Any settlement reached in the course of the mediation shall be referred to the arbitral tribunal appointed by SIAC and may be made a consent award on agreed terms. The parties' responsibility to pay any SIAC fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable SIAC Rules.\n\n11.7 Arbitration Award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n11.8 Costs of Arbitration. The parties shall bear their own attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (for North America, as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\n\n11.9 Waiver of Class Actions and Class Arbitrations. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, for any case not subject to the requirement to arbitrate (except to the limited extent discussed above for Mass Filings), you and NetEase agree to only bring disputes in an individual capacity and shall not (a) seek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class-wide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity, or (b) consolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit another to do so without the express consent of all parties to these Terms and all other actions or arbitrations. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under the subsection 11.4(c) entitled \"Batch Arbitration\". Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, determines that the limitations of this subsection are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and we agree that the particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the courts indicated in subsection 11.1(b) above. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This subsection does not prevent you or NetEase from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.\n\n11.10 Jury Trial Waiver. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you and NetEase agree to waive right to a jury trial. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.\n\n11.11 Opt-Out. You have the right to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following email address: disputes@oc.netease.com, within 30 days after first agreeing or becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your in-game username (or NetEase Games Account ID, if you have one), your contact email address, and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.\n\n11.12 Modification. We retain the right to modify this Arbitration Agreement in the future. Changes will be posted here, and you should regularly check for the most recent version. If we make any future, material change to this Arbitration Agreement, we will notify you through the contact information in your Account. Unless you opt out within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by informing us at the following email address: disputes@oc.netease.com, your continued use of the Software and Services after the effective date of any changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such change. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against NetEase or you prior to the effective date of the modification. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of these Terms and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (modified by any subsequent changes to these Terms you accepted) remain in full force and effect. We will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of these Terms.\n\n11.13 Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that each party may: (a) bring a qualifying claim over a Dispute in a small claims court or tribunal, or (b) seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party reserves the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's intellectual property or proprietary rights.\n\n\n\n12 Miscellaneous\n12.1 English Version. The English version of these Terms will be the version used when interpreting or construing these Terms.\n\n12.2 Non-Assignment. You may not assign or otherwise transfer these Terms or your rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without our written consent, and any such attempt will be void. We may assign or transfer our rights under these Terms to a third party without your consent.\n\n12.3 Entire Agreement. These Terms set forth the entire agreement between you and us, and supersede and replace any and every other prior or contemporaneous agreement or understanding that may have existed between you and us.\n\n12.4 Severability. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remainder of these Terms will continue in full force and effect and such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability.\n\n12.5 No Waiver. Our failure to enforce or exercise any provision of these Terms is not a waiver of that provision.\n\n12.6 Contact Us. If you have any further questions about these Terms, please contact us via the in-game customer services or on the official websites of our Services.\n\n\n\n13 Regional Terms\n13.1 California Residents. If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code § 1789.3, then you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.\n\n13.2 EEA Residents.

Your use of the App must comply with the App Store's applicable terms of use. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App. In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price, if any, for the App to you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by these Terms. You and NetEase acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims of yours or any third party relating to the App or your possession or use of the App, including, but not limited to: (a) product liability claims, (b) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, and (c) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.

You must comply with applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the App. You and NetEase acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as they relate to your use of the App, and that, upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.\n\n14.2 PlayStation Supplemental Terms.\n\n(a) SIEA.

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10110010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "Scientific inspiration, mused Bruce Banner, could come from anywhere. There were the famous stories — Newton's apple, Alexander Fleming's mold in the Petri dish — and then there were the thousands of other little revelations that would never be told because they were just part of the everyday work of scientists all over the world. Like him. He had done some important work in the fields of gamma radiation, and he had also learned more about gamma radiation the hard way.\nNow, he was trying to build both on that work and the life-changing accident. Becoming the Hulk had changed his life for better and for worse, and most of the worse aspects had to do with the lack of control he had felt for years when becoming Hulk. Over time, he had gotten more control, but it was still a struggle. Eventually he'd had an insight: What if he could control the infusion of gamma radiation into his body? Would it be possible to decide how much of a Hulk he wanted to be? \nThe question had led to a series of experiments, and now Bruce thought he was on the verge of a real working prototype of a device that could absorb, contain, and channel gamma radiation. \nIf so, it would be life-changing.\nSo here he was, tinkering with the final adjustments to what he was calling the Gamma Belt. The fundamental idea of the belt was that it contained a reservoir of gamma energy that could be channeled into the wearer's body.\nHe would never let anyone else use the belt, but if he could get it working, the transformation in Banner's life would be practically unthinkable. To have full control over the Hulk, without worrying about the mindless rages that had occasionally overtaken him for decades now? Banner had always found the Hulk as much a curse as a gift. There were times when it was great to be a super hero, but when you woke up one morning and discovered that the Hulk had leveled part of a city during a fight...\nSomething had to change. So now, Banner was changing something. \nIt was late at night, and the desert outside Banner's lab was quiet save for the eerie whistle of the breeze in the spines of the saguaro cactuses. It was a strange, lonely sound, perfect to accompany the work of a strange, lonely man. He shut the window and put the belt on, testing it for fit and making sure the gamma conduits were intact and not facing out. The Gamma Belt was designed to channel energy into the wearer's body, without letting it escape anywhere else. Banner had done this by lining the belt with conduits for the energy, and insulating the conduits in every direction except a small seam where the belt was in direct contact with the wearer. In testing, with the belt tightened around a mannikin, the insulation had worked. \nNow, he was going to find out if it worked on a real person.\nHe tightened the belt and settled it into place around his waist. Then he tested the gamma detectors he'd placed around the lab, making sure they were active. He'd arranged them to pick up any stray energy released when Banner activated the belt to become the Hulk.\nIt was going to feel strange to become the Hulk that way. For so many years, it had been just a sudden internal process. Now, Banner was trying to systematize it, channel it, make it not quite so vulnerable to his emotional states. In a way, putting his transformation under the control of an external object felt like losing control over it, even though the whole point of the Gamma Belt was to have better control over the Hulk. \nAnd, possibly, to make him stronger. Banner had run the math hundreds of times, and it was possible the Gamma Belt would be able to create a stronger Hulk. What that would mean for him, Banner wasn't sure. But he was about to find out.\nHe hadn't told anyone about the Gamma Belt, mostly because he didn't want to have a conversation about why he was building a device to do what he could already do. And the reason for avoiding that conversation was that Banner would have to admit that he wanted the belt to give him a kind of control over the Hulk that he'd never felt he could maintain. In other words, he didn't want to have a conversation about how he couldn't control the Hulk.\nOkay, he thought. Time to see if I've solved that problem.\nHe started a video camera set into one wall of the lab. \"Banner, Gamma Belt test. First go-round with a full energy reservoir.\"\nHe stepped to the center of the lab, where he'd marked out a spot for the transformation. Earlier that day, he'd moved all the lab furniture and equipment away from it.\n\"Commencing...\" He tapped a control on the belt. \"Now.\"\nLights on the belt flared to life as it poured gamma energy into the conduit encircling Bruce's waist. \nHe felt the transition like he always did: wrenching, painful, but also filling him with a sense of limitless power. Along with that came something even more important: ease. Where Banner was nearly crippled by anxieties about how other people felt about him, Hulk didn't care what anyone thought. He was Hulk!\nHe looked around Banner's lab, then down at the belt around his waist. How did Banner design it so it didn't break? \n\"Don't need the belt,\" Hulk grumbled. But he knew Banner had designed the experiment to help him, so Hulk reluctantly went ahead to do the rest of the steps Banner had planned in advance. At least they sounded like fun.\nFirst, Hulk went outside the lab, trudging down a dirt road that led into a box canyon. Banner had set up instruments along one wall of the canyon. Hulk was supposed to stand at the other wall and clap. Banner thought he could measure Hulk's strength this way. Hulk just wondered what the belt would do. \nHe stood by the canyon wall and looked at the instruments maybe twenty yards away. It was a narrow canyon. He took a deep breath, narrowed his eyes, and spread his arms wide.\nHulk's clap usually caused a shockwave strong enough to break windows, flip cars, and send Hulk's enemies flying. But when he brought his palms together and heard the ear-shattering CRACK, he knew right away that this clap was different.\nThe shock wave crashed against the far canyon wall like a bomb had gone off, collapsing the wall into a rockslide that buried Banner's instruments like they were never there. Then the wave rebounded and knocked Hulk into the wall at his back, hard enough to stun him — and bring thousands of tons of rock slabs crashing down on his head. Dazed, Hulk shook his head and flexed to push the rocks away...only to find that none of the rocks was touching him. A glowing sphere of gamma energy had surrounded him, projected from the belt. When Hulk moved, the sphere moved, shifting the rockfall so he could stand. Then it faded away.\nHulk looked down at the belt. \nIts reservoir was partly full. \nHulk looked across to the far wall. One of the instruments had survived the rockslide. Its microphone stuck up between rock slabs, and attached to it was a camera. Hulk walked to the camera and pointed down to the belt. \"See that?\"\nThen he decided to do another strength test and see what happened. He went outside, looked up to make sure no planes were going overhead, and jumped. He peaked a few thousand feet in the air, coming back down a short distance from his jump point with an impact that shook the windows in the lab. The arms of the saguaro cactuses waved. \nThe belt was two-thirds full. \nHulk grinned. \"Heh.\" \nNow he was going to try something even harder. He picked up a car parked near the lab and threw it into the air in a high arc. Before it could land, he thundered after it, leaping as it fell and smashing a fist into it before it could hit the ground. The car exploded into hundreds of pieces, its gas tank rupturing in a ball of flame that Hulk fell through back to the ground. He roared as he landed, an exultant roar that echoed out over the empty desert. \nThis was something Banner hadn't thought of. Becoming the Hulk, he had essentially given off enough gamma radiation to refill the belt...which in turn had fed the new radiation back into him. \nThe dose would have killed him...if he hadn't already survived a larger dose of gamma radiation years ago. Instead it made him...well, Hulkier.\nHe was a different Hulk. The real Hulk. The pure monster. He didn't care what Banner thought. Banner was weak. Hulk would rub Banner's face in it once and for all. \n\"Gonna show Banner,\" he growled to himself. \"Show him how puny he is when Hulk gets bigger!\"\nHulk stomped back into the lab and looked at the camera. Inside he felt Banner's fear and worry, deep inside his mind. He bared his teeth in a grin. \"See, Banner? More gamma, more Hulk. Gonna do it again!\"\nThat's not really a good idea. It was Banner's voice.\n\"Shut up, Banner.\"\nNo, you don't understand, if too much gamma radiation builds up, it could —\n\"SHUT UP!\" Hulk punctuated the roar with a double-fisted blow to the floor, coming down with all his strength. \nThe blast wave tore the concrete slab under the lab building to pieces and shattered equipment in every room. Sparks flew and cables tore out of the wall a moment before a row of lab tables smashed into the far side of the lab, breaking the window Banner had carefully shut before beginning the experiment. The roof started to come down, and Hulk roared as it destroyed itself over his head and shoulders.\nHulk, no—!\nHumiliating Banner felt good. Hulk wasn't done. \"Watch, Banner!\" he snarled, picking up a steel beam from the ceiling and smashing it to the ground, feeling bolts and fragments of concrete ricochet up from the floor off his invulnerable skin. Yes! He would tear the lab to the ground, and then —\nBanner collapsed to the floor among the smashed remains of his instruments, feeling the Hulk recede like a great tide of rage in his mind. He was breathing hard and saying \"no, no, no,\" until he realized he was saying it. When he stopped, the only sound in the lab was the whistling of the saguaro spines in the night breeze. Out in the desert, pieces of the car were burning slowly down. \nIn his hands he held the broken remains of the Gamma Belt. Ricocheting fragments of the lab table had punched through its electronics, returning him instantly to his Banner state. \"Interesting,\" he said. He hadn't considered that possibility.\nHe looked from the smashed remains of the Gamma Belt to the smashed remains of the lab, then out to the dirt track leading to the canyon. The remains of the car still burned at the edge of the desert.\nThere were a lot of things he hadn't considered. It was time to get back to work.",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10140010_HeroGalleryInfo_Story_#0_Content": "The year 2099. The future had seen countless advancements in technology and pharmaceuticals thanks to companies like Stark-Fujikawa and Alchemax. Safety and security were at an all-time high as well, due in large part to the proactive police force known as the Public Eye. At a glance, everything seemed perfect. A little too perfect. \nBut a closer look revealed another story. Even though the quality of life had improved dramatically for everyday citizens, there were still those who lurked in the shadows, searching for ways to use that miraculous progress for their own personal gain. In every utopia, there was always someone desperate to turn the brave new world upside down. Fortunately, there were also those who had dedicated their long lives to stopping them… at any cost…  \nThose forces were destined to collide in a warehouse on the lowest levels of a forgotten district of Tokyo, far below the strange webs that had woven themselves through the night sky. There, the Yashida Corporation — once one of Japan’s greatest crime families and now a multinational manufacturing powerhouse — was set to meet with a mysterious new syndicate rumored to be making a move for power in New York City: the Castigliones. \nWhile the Yashida Corp. had gone legit decades ago, they still had a number of illicit operations hidden in their books, dealing in everything from narcotics to weapons. Tonight, the focus was on the latter.  \nLed by Shiru Yashida, a direct descendant of Lord Shingen himself, the Yashida Corp.’s delegation numbered over twenty armed men. They were trained to remain cold and confident, but they couldn’t help but snicker when the door to the warehouse slid open and a single figure in a long dark coat walked into the darkness.\n“Let’s get down to business, shall we?” the man representing the Castigliones said in a gruff voice. \n“Bold,” Shiru said with a smile. “I already like you, Mr…?”\n“Tower,” the man replied coldly. “Johnny Tower. Now what’ve you got for me?”\nThe Yashida Corp. crew wasted no time, unveiling a table covered in a wide array of high-tech weaponry unlike anything that had been seen on the streets of Tokyo or any other city. Plasma cannons, EMP grenades, vibro-knives, and countless other innovations designed solely to cause their targets the most damage and pain possible. These were weapons of war, and the Yashidas had no qualms about unleashing them on the innocent people of New York. For the right price, of course. \nAfter the Yashidas finished their presentation, Tower paused for what seemed like ages, scanning over the table of weapons in silence. The tension that filled the warehouse escalated until he finally spoke.\n“I’ll take all of ‘em,” Tower said, his cold expression never changing. \n“Surely, a young syndicate such as yours cannot yet afford —” Shiru began in astonishment, unable to finish his thought before Tower interjected.  \n“Didn’t say I would pay for ‘em,” Tower interrupted. “Said I’d take ‘em.” \nShiru Yashida began to laugh as he reached for the sword dangling from his belt. It was a family heirloom, once belonging to an esteemed ancestor of his, the Mutant known as the Silver Samurai. While Shiru did not possess any powers himself, he had trained in swordsmanship since he was a boy. And he knew he could best anyone — especially some petty New York mobster who didn’t seem to know his station. \n“I’ll take that sword off your hands, too,” Tower said, his grim face finally softening into a smirk. \n“What is it you Americans say?” asked Shiru, signaling to his men to draw their weapons. “Ah, yes… Over my dead body.”\nJohnny Tower reached into his long coat and drew out a pistol that looked as though it had been manufactured a century ago. Before anyone could react, there was a bang and Shiru Yashida fell to the ground in motionless heap. \n“Deal,” Tower sneered at him. \nA split second later Johnny Tower was bombarded by a firestorm of bullets from the weapons of the other members of the Yashida delegation. Tower tried to stand strong, but he stumbled backwards as the projectiles hit his chest over and over again, the force of the impacts eventually driving him to his knees. When the barrage ended, Tower stood up and dusted himself off as if nothing had happened. \n“Shoulda aimed for the head like I did,” Tower grunted, lunging forward and grabbing a cutting-edge plasma cannon from the table of weapons. \nHe opened fire on the Yashidas, who could only stare in utter disbelief. It wasn’t the fact that Tower had survived their merciless attack that made them freeze in their tracks. It was what they saw peering out from beneath Tower’s tattered black shirt: \nA stark white skull gazing back at them from the front of a bulletproof vest. \nThe mark of the Punisher. \nFor many of them, stories of the Punisher were like fairy tales. The vigilante who hunted criminals in the night. The real Punisher, a man named Frank Castle, had lived — and died — ages ago. So who was this man opening fire at them now? Someone who had styled himself after the legend? Or a ghost of the past seeking vengeance? \nIf Johnny Tower had his way, none of them would live to find out. With their leader on ice, he planned to use the tight quarters of the warehouse to methodically pick off each Yashida Corp. goon one-by-one. But there was one thing he hadn’t planned for. Company. \n“That’s enough,” a woman’s voice yelled as Tower spewed a volley of plasma bursts toward the cowering Yashida guards. “Let them go.”\nTower looked up and saw a woman perched up in the rafters of the warehouse, as if she was ready to pounce down on him. \n“Not a chance, doll,” Tower responded, snarling in her direction. \n“Don’t call me, doll…” the woman said, leaping down to land next to Tower, “…Frank.”\n“What’d you call me?” Tower said, caught off guard by the woman using his real name. No one had called him that in decades. As he looked closer, he couldn’t believe his eyes. He knew exactly who she was… and he was just as shocked to see her as the Yashida clan had been to see him. \n“What’s the matter, Castle?” the red-haired woman said with a smirk. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” \n“Natasha #$%@in’ Romanoff,” Castle grunted in disbelief. “The Black Widow herself. You look pretty good for… What…? 140 years old now?”\n“I could say the same about you,” Natasha replied, quickly dispatching the remaining Yashida guards with a torrent of non-lethal blasts of her Widow’s Bite. “What’s your secret?” \n“Clean living,” Johnny Tower — or rather, Frank Castle — said. “That and some back alley treatments with a knock-off Super-Soldier Serum. You?” \n“Same,” Natasha replied. “Well, almost. I got my life-enhancing formula from Nick Fury.” \n“That old bastard always did have a thing for dames in cat suits…” Castle mused. “So what the hell are you doing here? Other than blowing my cover?”\n“Pretty sure you’d already done that yourself way before I jumped in,” Natasha said. “But if you really want to know, I’ve been on the run.” \n“From who?” Castle asked. “Most people have no idea you still exist. Same as me.” \n“That may have changed…” Natasha said, careful about how much she chose to reveal to the vigilante by her side. “I found out that Alchemax was hiding a top-secret asset, something at a level of classification I’d never even heard of.”\n“So naturally you couldn’t resist stickin’ your pretty little head into their business,” Castle said. \n“What I found there…” Natasha continued. “It could change everything…” \n“Well, what was it?” Castle asked impatiently.\n“Not what…” Natasha said. “Who.”\n“No more games, woman,” Castle barked. “If you’ve got somethin’ to say, spit it out already!”\n“It was Captain America, Frank,” Natasha said. \n“That… That ain’t possible…” Castle stammered, caught entirely off guard for the first time in ages. Cap was the reason he had signed up to be a soldier in the first place, long, long ago. But the Sentinel of Liberty had disappeared at the end of World War II, never to be found.\n“I barely believed it myself,” Natasha said as she played back the recent rescue operation in her mind’s eye. “But it was him. Steve Rogers. In the flesh.” \n“So where’s old stars and stripes now?” Castle asked, a tinge of hope in his voice. \n“He saved my life…” Natasha said, “…and then he vanished.”\n“And you’re tellin’ me the most elite spy who ever lived hasn’t managed to track a guy in star-spangled armor down yet?” Castle was starting to see some holes in her story. \n“I’ve been a bit distracted,” Natasha admitted. “After all, I just took your place at the top of the Public Eye’s most wanted list.”\n“Aww, come on!” Castle groaned. “Do you know how hard I worked to earn that spot?” \n“You’re welcome to have it back,” Natasha said. “Since that mission, I had to go underground, cut all ties with my network. It’s been a mess.” \n“So why’d you come out of the woodwork tonight?” Castle asked. \n“Because I need your help,” Natasha said earnestly.\n“Those aren’t words I hear very often,” Castle replied. “Especially from a hero like you. I don’t usually walk with the angels.” \n“Well, you’d better decide whose side you’re on fast,” Natasha said, raising her gauntlets and aiming them toward the warehouse door. “They’re here.” \nRight on cue, a squad of Public Eye soldiers burst into the warehouse, ordering the Black Widow and the Punisher to freeze. Natasha looked at Castle, who let out a sigh and nodded his head in mild annoyance. Without a word he grabbed two high-tech guns off the table, tossing one to his new partner. \n“Hit to wound, not to kill,” Natasha said as the two opened fire on the advancing officers. \n“Or what?” asked Castle snidely as he wrapped his arm around an officer’s throat and pressed his weapon against the side of the gasping man’s head.  \n“Or I save my last round for you,” Natasha said, shooting several Public Eye soldiers in the kneecaps.  \nCastle released the officer from his grip, letting him slump to the ground unconscious. \n“Death’s been on my heels for ages,” Castle said. “But it’s gonna have to wait a bit longer. At least until after I meet Cap. So let’s get this over with already…” \nCastle leapt forward and grabbed a tiny metal disc from the table and pressed a glowing button on its surface. As he tossed it onto the ground in front of them, Natasha instinctively began to run for cover, assuming it was an explosive. \n“You’re gonna wanna stay and watch this,” Castle said with a smile, running toward the device as it began to unfold. Within moments, a high-tech turret stood in its place. Frank jumped into the center of the giant gun and grabbed the handles. \n“Frank! No!” Natasha called as the Punisher gleefully opened fire on the Public Eye’s forces, raining destruction down upon them. \n“Don’t get all worked up,” he said. “I set it to stun. I think.” \nWhen the dust settled, Natasha raced over to one of the fallen officers and took his pulse. Castle wasn’t lying. He had held back from using lethal force. She was impressed. Maybe she had made the right choice coming to him after all. \n“See… you can trust me…” Castle said. “The problem is…” \nHe raised a gun and pointed it at Natasha. \n“…I’m not sure I can trust you. I know that the Yashidas paid off the Public Eye. So there’s no way the cops would’ve come here to bust our deal tonight. And like I said, you’re the best spy in the world. So they wouldn’t have been able to find you either…” \nCastle grabbed Natasha’s wrist and gave it a squeeze, forcing her hand open. In her palm was a small tracking device, giving off a locator signal. \n“…unless you wanted them to.” \n“I had to find a way to make sure you’d have my back,” Natasha said, realizing her gambit could have severely damaged the trust she had hoped to establish with her new ally. \n“And now I’ve gotta make sure you’re not gonna stab mine,” Castle said.\n“Trust has never been something either of us have had much of,” Natasha said. “But if we want to find Steve… if we want to stop the Public Eye… to beat Doom… I’m starting to realize it’s something we’re going to need.” \nCastle sighed as he lowered his weapon. \n“Must be goin’ soft in my old age,” he said. \n“Yeah,” Natasha laughed. “You’re a regular Peni Parker.” \n“Got any leads on where Cap ran off to?” Castle asked as the pair exited the warehouse and stepped out into the crisp Tokyo night. \n“Just one…” Natasha said, looking up at the starry sky above them, “…and I’ve got a feeling you’re not going to believe it.”",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10150010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "Very few Mutants had the honor of serving on both the Quiet Council of Krakoa and the Great Ring of Arakko simultaneously. Ororo Munroe was one, and she had long looked forward to the day when the two sentient islands might be reunited. She had not, however, counted on it happening quite like this. It had begun without her even knowing, while she was walking along the coral shoals that, together with a great oceanic lagoon, separated Arakko from the great red desert of Mars. The tiny whirls and eddies in time grew almost instantly into a great wave of disruption. Ordinarily, Storm was hypersensitive to tiny changes in the atmosphere around her, due to the nature of her Mutant powers, but she had been preoccupied with the next challenge to her seat on the Great Ring, and let that preoccupation distract her from her immediate sensory environment. \nNow aware that something was happening before she understood what, her pulse quickened, then slowed again to a thud. Raindrops slowed, hung still in the air, then hurtled again toward the ground, each one at a different speed. Clouds tore across the sky, cleared, then rebuilt themselves into great black walls, all in seconds — behind them the sky inverting its normal uniform brilliant blue. Streaks of indigo and black split from horizon to horizon, revealing stars that were not the stars Storm knew.\nShe raised a hand and saw raindrops falling on her skin — and others passing straight through her hand as if they weren't there. All around her plants grew, bloomed, and died, all in an instant. Trees split the skies, growing two hundred feet high and toppling, becoming soil again before their falling trunks even hit the ground. The air was thick with flowers, and insects moving through a million generations before her eyes as she drew a single breath.\nArakko and Krakoa both appeared before her, partly as if they were superimposed on each other. Then Ororo realized she was seeing it wrong; the two islands were colliding, molding into one another as the overlapping timelines tore away all boundaries of sense. The Red Keep and the Tower of Broken Will overlapped, merged, hybridized, and became something new that Storm couldn't quite focus on before it was all swept away in the next spasm of the time disruption. Krakoa's bays and Arakko's coral swirled into new configurations. Krakoa's quarry and the Circle Perilous of Arakko blended into each other before finally breaking free, but now the quarry contained Arakkan combatants and the Circle Perilous bewildered mutants of Krakoa. The forests of both islands overgrew each other and separated again, each featuring new species and unknown hybrids. The harder the wind blew, the faster the transformations, and now Storm saw tiny slivers of some new material appearing in the tempest, sleeting down to the island's surface and shores. The particles stung when they hit her skin — a pain that wasn't entirely physical. It was as if they were injuring her ability to locate herself in space and time. She reeled momentarily, then got her bearings again\nThe particles rained down over the islands, driving both into a frenzy. Arakko and Krakoa briefly fought each other, bitter as only siblings can be. Storm, standing on their soil with one foot in each world, knew she would be subsumed and destroyed if she did not do something. And as deformed time tore through her being again, rippling her mind the way wind would ripple her hair, she realized what she could do.\nThis was a storm across all of time. \nAnd if it was a storm, she could control it.\nStorm's power over weather was instinctive and had been since she was a girl. This was new and would not be guided by instinct but by her conscious mind — which was under constant distraction by the onslaught of particles. They ruined her concentration, and kept her from grounding herself in the here and now, which was necessary if she was to bring her powers to bear on this tumult. \nAnd she was not the only one suffering from the particles. The islands, brutally crushed into each other's reality, wailed in pain and fear, both a sound like a hurricane wind and a psychic scream that rang in Storm's mind. This spurred her into action. She may have been the Regent of Arakko, but she still had responsibilities to Krakoa as well. \nThe time-storm was forcing them together, and also twisting a new reality into being around them. Storm felt those currents of power, realized they moved in a system, and for a moment understood that system. Her Mutant powers responded. The way electrical charges crackled about her body when she controlled lightning, now space-time itself rippled around her body, creating glimpses of a million different Ororo Munroes from a million different realities, but none of them could disturb or displace her. She found herself in control, and she began to quiet the storm. Its boundaries, she knew, extended far beyond her ability to control it, but she had influence over this one small part, and that she intended to use. Krakoa and Arakko were at stake, and with them, the lives of thousands of mutants who would otherwise be adrift on the timestream. She could not let the time-storm merge the two islands together. The islands both feared for their survival, and they began to tear at one another psychically, with greater intensity as their fear created a feedback loop. \nOnly Storm could stop this madness. She began to guide the currents of the storm, shunting away the most damaging gusts and finding smoother paths for both Krakoa and Arakko to move through...time? Was she guiding them through time, the way a skilled ship's captain brought a vessel through a storm to safer harbors? If so, where would they arrive? \nGradually, slowly, she channeled the powers of the time-storm around the two living islands, letting them re-divide into their own entities, drifting further and further apart. Heavier fronts of the stinging particles blew through, and now they were larger, merging into crystals. They precipitated from the storm the way rain precipitated from clouds too heavy with moisture. Who had caused this time-storm? How were different realities becoming entangled and overlaid on each other? \nThese were questions for another time. Now she had to make sure the storm was passing, and not just gathering itself for another onslaught. She felt its energy dwindle, even as the crystals fell in greater numbers all around her, all across the islands' surface—and as she had that thought, she looked around and realized that the chronal outburst had subsided. \nKrakoa and Arakko had nearly become one, in a collapse that could have destroyed them both, and doubtless would have annihilated many of the lives on each. The aftershocks and echoes of their psychic battle still churned in the air around her, but like the time-storm, that battle was almost over. Storm stood on the coastline of Krakoa gazing out at the ocean, and...\nWait. When the time-storm had begun, Storm had been on Mars. On Arakko. Now, as reality settled back into place, she saw that she was on Krakoa, at the edge of Hellfire Bay, where the White Palace and Blackstone stared each other down from opposing promontories. The air smelled new, sharp with life and the scent of a just-passed storm — but it was definitely Earth air. Ororo looked around her, over beautiful living Krakoa, and despite her jarring dislocation, she felt an almost maternal pride at the way she had brought it through the crisis.\nBut how had it happened? And now that it was over, how had Storm been transported millions of miles without ever passing through a Krakoan gateway? Had Arakko been safely returned to its home on Mars? Was this even the same timeline that the living islands had occupied before the time-storm? It had been more powerful than anything she had ever felt, maybe even more powerful than her brief contact with the Phoenix Force. Who had caused it, and how? More importantly, why? What damage had been done to the mutants living on both islands? How could she ensure this did not happen again? These were a leader's questions. More personally, Storm was anxious to know that her friends and loved ones were all right. She would have to seek them out, both on Krakoa and Arakko, to make sure they had weathered the time-storm. And what of the broader world? What was the situation in New York, or Wakanda? Would she even find the same New York, or the same Wakanda, that she had once known? \nAll around her, the crystals precipitated from the storm lay thick on the ground. Storm bent and gathered several of them in her hand. Like a mineral made of time, she thought. \nXavier needed to hear about this immediately. Magneto as well, although Storm decided on the spot that Xavier should know first. Both old adversaries believed themselves to have Mutants' best interests in mind, but Storm's vision aligned much more closely with Xavier's. \nWhere was he? Here on Krakoa, or elsewhere in this world? Was it a new world, a new time, or had she misunderstood the nature of the storm?\nStorm saw people emerging from the forests of Krakoa. Some of them she recognized, some were new to her. They saw her, high on the ridge overlooking the ocean, and they looked to her for guidance. No matter where they hailed from — Krakoa or Arakko, Earth or Mars, the past, present, or future — she knew one thing: She would not let them down. "

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10160010_HeroGalleryInfo_Biography_#0_Content": "Born the son of Laufey, king of the Frost Giants, Loki was adopted by Odin and raised as a prince of Asgard. But his true nature could not be undone, and Loki would come to fully embrace his role as the God of Mischief.\nWith his father deep in the Odinsleep, Loki seized his chance to take the throne for himself. After enlisting Hela in his plot and hurling his brother Thor into a distant timeline, Loki now harvests Chronovium sap from the World Tree, Yggdrasill, in an effort to conquer the entire timestream.",
    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10160010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "In the immediate aftermath of the reckless mortals’ clumsy scrambling of timelines, Loki noticed something quite curious. The sap bleeding from Yggdrasil had a new, particularly magical essence. \nHe began to experiment with it. Shape it. Concentrate and intensify it. Time, he discovered, was the core of its essence, and right away, he conceived an intense desire to visit a future Asgard to see what mischief he might make there.\nQuickly, he learned how to do just that, but he came away not only disappointed but frightened and—not that he ever would have admitted it—saddened. For the future Asgard he beheld was a ruin, its throne broken and cast down, its collections looted, its surviving people grubbing in the ruins to survive.\nNo, Loki thought. Surely this is not Asgard’s only future.\nHe brewed the enchantment once more…and discovered an Asgard overrun by Jotun, with Laufey himself grunting on the throne and Asgard’s people little more than bones.\nAnd another Asgard in flames, with Surtur bestride the blazing trunk of Yggdrasil while the fabled towers of the realm collapsed in fiery rubble.\nAnd another, windswept and empty, the Cask of Eternal Winters broken open in the throne room.\nAnd another, shattered into drifting fragments against a sea of stars.\nAnd another, impossibly sunk under an ocean, with vast shadows moving in the moonlit waters above.\nHundreds more, thousands more. Asgards burned, Asgards frozen, Asgards overrun by Dark Elves or dwarves or enemies from Midgard or the worlds beyond the stars. A Kree-devastated Asgard, an Asgard ravaged by the Eternals, an Asgard ruled by an alien overlord whose minions oozed and sprang like living shadows, hunting down the last of the realm’s true subjects. In all of these, Loki did not find the one thing for which he truly searched.\nHimself.\nAnd then, at last, an Asgard mighty and unbroken. An Asgard overarched by Yggdrasil’s branches and underpinned by Yggdrasil’s roots. Her towers shining, her people vibrant and untroubled, her wealth untouched…and her throne occupied by Loki.\nHe reeled back into his own time, mind aflame with the implications of what he had seen. How many destroyed Asgards had he witnessed? After all that, to see the one surviving realm be ruled by himself…\nWell, Loki thought. The only Asgard that survives this absurd misadventure is one in which my true destiny is at last acknowledged, my primacy accepted, my sovereignty celebrated. As it should be. Now remains the work of bringing this future to pass.\nImmediately the crucial points of the plan presented themselves to him. First, or course, he would have to maneuver the All-Father into the deep enchanted slumber of Odinsleep. Tricky, but he had done it before. The biggest obstacle was making sure that Heimdall didn’t notice until it was too late. Then, Loki would use Thor’s desire to help their father against him, guiding him into a certain place where Loki wouldn’t have to worry about him for a long time.\nBut these were powerful enchantments, even for Loki. He was going to need to bring in a co-conspirator or two. It would be easy enough to betray them and rid himself of them later, but for a brief time they would be useful. Karnilla, of course. Aligning with the Norns was an absolute necessity if he were to retain rule over Asgard and not see it suffer any of the tragic fates he had witnessed. And while a master of magic, the Queen of the Norns was no great schemer — at least not compared to the God of Lies. \nHe also thought of Karnilla’s closest ally, Hela. She would be useful because of her vast power and unlimited legions, who would keep the Valkyrior and Crimson Hawks busy, leaving the throne unguarded…\nIf Loki could just figure out what to offer Hela in return.\n*\nHe manifested in her realm unannounced, just because he could, and he knew it annoyed her. As soon as she sensed his presence, Hela sent an escort. This time, it was a retinue of fallen Asgardian warriors riding skeletal horses and singing the ghostly songs of the Asgardian dead who never made it to Valhalla. To the accompaniment of these mournful, discordant strains, Loki followed his escort to Hela’s throne. In this kingdom, bones twisted by dark magic paved the path to her castle while particularly favored souls became feasts for her Nastrond crows. Loki hated the décor even more than he hated the thought of Thor sitting on the throne of Asgard. Well, perhaps not quite that much.\nAnd speaking of thrones, Hela sat on hers, regarding him with an imperious and icy stare as he approached and the ghostly retinue vanished. “Loki,” she said. “Whatever foolish scheme has brought you here, be assured it will not succeed. Return to your realm and disturb me no further.”\n“O my great queen, it—”\n“Whenever you call me queen, Loki— I know you want something. Tell me what it is and spare me the insincere implication that you care about dignity.”\n“Oh, I do,” he said. “I do very much.  We both rule realms, and we have a responsibility to rule them as well as possible. Unfortunately, we are not currently doing that, because I am not ruling Asgard. I propose to rectify this error, and —”\n“And you want my help.”\n“Yes,” Loki said. “My plan will succeed with or without you— ”\nFor the third time, she interrupted him. “Why should I?”\n“Why, to be rid of the All-Father, whose time is past — and to be rid of our beloved Odinson, who would otherwise succeed to the throne of Asgard.”\n“Which is the one thing you cannot stand to see happen.” \nLoki did not give her the satisfaction of agreeing. \n“You see, Loki,” Hela said, “of all master plotters, you are the easiest to predict because all of your plots are ultimately only about one thing.”\nLoki inclined his head, again unwilling to make a verbal acknowledgement. \n“You have been working new magic. I smell it on you,” Hela said. “Tell me.”\n“Ah. The sap of Yggdrasil. Observe.” Loki cut a small notch in one of the World-Tree’s roots. As the sap oozed out, he captured it and began to work a charm to extract its essence. “As the World-Tree shapes the limits of our realms,” he said, “this substance shapes the limits of our time.” After a moment he held a small ball of what looked like amber in the palm of his hand. “Take it. It will show you the future of your realm just as it showed me the future of mine.”\n“Yours? You speak of Asgard?”\n“Yes,” Loki said. “That is why I wanted to see you.”\nHe placed the ball in Hela’s hand and began to describe what he had seen.\n*\n“Ah,” she said when they had returned from the visionary voyage. \n“Yes, it is quite deserving of an ‘ah,’” Loki said. “But the real question is, will you help me?”\n“I will,” Hela said. “But I have my own vision for this — Chronovium — for it has fallen in my realm as well. In return for my help, you will help me bring this vision to fruition.”\n“Of course,” Loki said, intending it to be a lie — but not even he knew when an attempted lie might become an inadvertent truth.",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10170010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "Johnny Storm saw a vampire skulking along the edge of Bryant Park, and did what he always did on such an occasion: Lit it up like a Roman candle. Then he saw another one, trying to get away around the corner onto Fifth Avenue. Boom, that one was gone too. He did this every night — or every day, it was hard to tell what time it was in Dracula's New York, because the sun never came up and the moon always hung low and red seemingly right over Grand Central. Either way, the Human Torch kept the area near the Baxter Building as free of vampires as he could. That meant a lot of vampires had gone up in smoke because of him, and that in turn meant that Johnny Storm was currently Number One on Dracula's hit list. The vampire-in-chief had sent some of his top lieutenants after Johnny, veterans of the Cult of the Darkholders, but either Johnny had lit them up too, or he'd gotten away before they could get a bite on him.\nVampires couldn't bite you when you were made of superheated plasma. \nThat was one reason why he went out on these patrols every day. He was safer than more New Yorkers from the threat of vampires, which made him especially well suited to vampire population control, especially in the area around the Baxter Building, which was uncomfortably close to Dracula's castle. Johnny did this because he didn't want vampires around the Baxter Building, but also because he knew that smoking so many vampires right around the castle—where Dracula would watch— was like waving a big old middle finger at the vampire lord. He might have stopped time and imprisoned New York in a weird eternal blood moon night, but that didn't mean New Yorkers were just going to give up.\nJohnny stayed in the air, heading south on Madison to make sure no masses of undead monsters were gathering in that direction. Also he thought Ben Grimm was doing his own sweeps of the section of Park Avenue south of Dracula's castle. Probably vampires couldn't bite Ben either, but Johnny wanted to make sure. They couldn't afford to lose him. There were so many vampires, so many monsters, and not nearly enough super heroes left to defend the innocent from them. Blade was around, Moon Knight, the Scarlet Witch...pretty quickly, Johnny ran out of names. \nOh. There was also Spider-Man, of course. One of Johnny's oldest friends, he stayed to fight vampires, but he also was dying to get back across the East River and see about Aunt May in Queens. New York wouldn't be New York without him.\nJohnny decided to angle over to Park and see if Ben was staying out of trouble. He hadn't seen any vampires in a few blocks. As he swooped diagonally over the shadowed buildings lining Park Avenue, he heard an echoing boom and saw a column of smoke blast upward from the center of the street. As it cleared, Johnny saw something so crazy that it took him a minute to convince himself it was actually real.\nThe creature that tore its way up through the street was a midnight blue in color, maybe ten times the size of an elephant, had three-digit pincers instead of hands, and moved like a dinosaur in an old stop-motion monster movie. It was one of the Deviant Mutates the FF had run into on their first mission together, way back when. Mole Man had a whole stable of bizarre creatures ready to unleash on the world. Johnny remembered this one because it was made of stone, but somehow still moved. Kind of like Ben Grimm, now that he thought about it. And now here it was tearing a huge hole in Park Avenue, revealing a destroyed subway tunnel below, and a cavern below that. \nAs he got a better look at it, Johnny realized that something was different about it, and its surprise appearance suddenly made a lot more sense. \nIts eyes, he saw, burned with the empty glow you saw in lower-level vampires, the minions Dracula and the other more powerful vampires created at will.\nSo not only was it a giant rock monster, Johnny thought; it was a giant vampire rock monster. Clearly Dracula was sick of just throwing more and more humanoid vampires at Johnny. He'd decided to take a different tack. \nThis was a problem. Johnny couldn't burn it, so he wasn't sure at first how to fight back as the creature smashed its way up Madison Avenue toward the Baxter Building. \nIt bared stony fangs and snapped at Johnny, who veered out of the way, streaking its side with fire to no effect. Holy smokes, he thought, was it a vampire now too? \n\"How did they even bite this thing?\" Johnny wondered out loud. It was made of stone. If he couldn't burn it. how could a vampire bite it?\nThe creature swiped at Johnny, missed, and brought its gigantic pincers down on the street hard enough that manhole covers up and down Madison Avenue flew up into the air like giant spinning coins. \nFrom the corner of 33rd, Ben Grimm charged into view. \"Torch, ya just draw trouble wherever ya go,\" he growled. \"Vampires ain't bad enough?\"\n\"This one's a vampire too!\" Johnny called back as the creature bared stone fangs and snapped at Ben. The Thing swatted its jaws to the side and tried to stomp it back into the hole it had made. \n\"Crazy!\" he shouted. \"This town's gone ta heck in a handbasket since Dracula came along.\"\nThe monster shook Ben off and tried to spring on him, but for a guy made out of orange rocks, Ben Grimm was fairly nimble. He got out of the way. \"What are we gonna do about it?\"\nThis was a good question. Johnny couldn't burn it, so the best thing they could do was what Ben was trying to do: Put it back in its hole and make sure it didn't come out again. \nThe monster snapped at Johnny again as he swooped close, harrying it — and it might have gotten him, too, if a taut cable of spider-webbing hadn't thwipped out of nowhere and pulled its head to the side.\n\"Hey, Torch!\" Spider-Man called out as he swung into view. \"My Spidey-Sense has been tingling like crazy for the last ten minutes. Now I know why.\"\n\"You're just in time,\" Johnny answered, as he distracted the monster again by swooping close to its snapping jaws—and then narrowly avoiding its pincers, which stabbed through the air where he'd been just a second before. \"Get some webs on it, Pete! I'm going to dive under it.\"\n\"You're gonna what?\" the Thing echoed incredulously.\n\"Easy,\" Johnny said. \"Pete gets it hanging over the hole, I get underneath it, then break the webs and I'll help it down into the hole.\"\n\"From underneath?\" the Thing echoed again.\n\"Trust me!\" Johnny said as he dodged another pincer.\n\"I can't break my webs,\" Spider-Man said. \"They're too strong.\"\n\"Can I?\" the Thing asked. \"Don't remember ever trying.\"\n\"Maybe?\" Spider-Man wondered. \"I'd hate to plan on it, you know?\"\n\"Yeah.\" Johnny had a thought. \"Ben, if you can't break the webs, you can just tear off the part of the building they're stuck to, right?\"\n\"Sure,\" Ben said. \"But you forgot one thing. I can't climb like him,\" jutting a rocky thumb at Spider-Man, \"and I can't fly like you.\"\nJohnny glanced over at Spider-Man, and saw that Pete was reaching the same conclusion he was. \"I think we can work around that,\" he said.\n\"Aw, no,\" Ben said. \"I don't wanna—\"\nBut Spider-Man had already snapped a web onto his back and started swinging him up into the air. More webs followed, binding the monster to the upper corners of buildings on both sides of Park Avenue, so it hung in the middle, half-in and half-out of the hole it had made. \nHere was the hard part, Johnny thought. He had to get the monster to stay in one place, and the best way to do that was to offer himself up as bait. So he dove underneath it, and the monster pounced. Both of its pincers clamped down on Johnny, not hurting him much but keeping him pinned as the monster bared its fangs. Here's where he would find out if he was right that vampires couldn't bite superheated plasma, Johnny thought. \nHe focused and felt his temperature get hotter. Then hotter still. Then so hot that the subway tracks and the concrete pillars inside the ruined station started to buckle. \"Now, Ben!\" he shouted again.\nUp above, Ben Grimm tore Spider-Man's web away from its anchor on the corner of the office tower. Maybe a cubic yard of brick and concrete came with it, tumbling down to crash onto the monster's stone carapace. \nAnd Johnny Storm went nova.\nThe vast mass of the stone monster blocked most of the nova blast from surging upward and out onto the street. The blast wave radiated downward into the tunnel carved by the stone Deviant on its way up from the deep caves where it originated, melting stone along with the reinforced concrete of the subway tunnel. \nThe monster couldn't burn, but the shock of the nova blast stunned it and let Johnny break free. He streaked up out of the hole as it collapsed over the monster, which tumbled into the bottomless cavern it had crawled out of just a few minutes before. Molten asphalt, steel, and stone sealed the hole, cooling quickly into a huge pit in the middle of Park Avenue.\nWhew, Johnny thought. \"Flame off,\" he said, and dropped to the street. Ben lowered into view on the end of one of Spider-Man's webs. \n\"This is humiliatin',\" he said.\n\"Couldn't have done it without you, Benjy,\" Johnny grinned. \nAs the Thing's feet hit the pavement, Spider-Man swung down and landed next to him. \"Pretty neat trick,\" he said.\n\"Yeah, not bad,\" Johnny said. \"All about the teamwork.\"\n\"Who ever heard of a vampire rock monster?\" Ben was looking at the pit. Then his wonderment was replaced by his typical pessimism. \"It might come up again, ya know.\"\nJohnny looked down at the wreckage, then up Park Avenue toward Dracula's castle. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I know. This isn't a war we're going to win tonight. But it is a war we're going to win.\"\nThe longer he looked at Dracula's castle, the more Johnny imagined he could see Dracula looking back at him, cold and angry at the failure of his latest scheme to extinguish the Human Torch once and for all. \nHe loved it. \"Come and get me,\" he dared the distant vampire lord. \"If you've got the guts.\"",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10180010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Title": "Unexpected Guest",
    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10180010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "It was another sweltering summer night on the island of Manhattan. Though the sun had gone down hours earlier, the residual heat it left behind still radiated from the pavement in shimmering waves. The forecast had not called for any relief from the record temperatures in the immediate future, but the residents of Greenwich Village had come to expect the unexpected thanks to one of their more… colorful neighbors. So when a powerful blast of icy air swept down Bleecker Street, it barely drew any attention. At least from those outside. Within the confines of the building marked “177A,” however, someone had most certainly taken notice of the sudden chill.\n“We have a visitor,” said Doctor Stephen Strange, barely looking up from the ancient tome in front of him. The Sorcerer Supreme was sitting cross-legged, floating a few feet in the air as he studied the arcane rituals within the sacred text. He paused for a moment before speaking again, this time with a slightly more commanding tone. “Wong, do get the door, please. We mustn’t keep our guest waiting.”  \n“Wong’s out on a supply run,” a gruff voice replied from below. “Guess we ran outta Eye of Newt or somethin’. How come you never told me we were expectin’ company, Doc?” \n“Because we weren’t,” Strange replied as he looked down at Bats, the ghostly basset hound that had recently become one of his most faithful companions. Strange unfolded his legs and gently landed on the floor of his study. “But invited or not, this is one visitor that it would be best not to turn away without at least hearing what he has to say. After all, he has traveled quite far to get here… haven’t you, Victor?” \n“Indeed I have, Stephen,” replied the unexpected guest in an authoritative voice. There, in the hallway just outside of Doctor Strange’s inner sanctum, stood the metal-clad monarch of Latveria — the villainous Victor von Doom.\n“How the heck did he get in here?!” Bats said with a low growl, the green glow from his spectral form intensifying. “This place is supposed to be intruder-proof!” \n“It seems the good doctor’s Sanctum Sanctorum is desperately in need of some more powerful protection spells,” Doom replied snidely. “And perhaps a better watchdog as well…”\n“I suppose I could use to change a few mystic locks,” Strange said with a smirk, “though I scarcely have to worry about anyone getting past the front door. After all, there aren’t many other mortals as adept at sorcery as you.” \n“You flatter me, Stephen,” Doom replied. “Do go on.” \n“It’s true,” Strange continued. “I may be this dimension’s Sorcerer Supreme, but when it comes to the mastery of the Dark Arts, you may very well be my equal. Which makes the fact that you’ve come here even more concerning. If you need my help, then something must be very wrong…”\n“Everything is wrong, Stephen,” Doom said, “and it has been for far too long. But I believe I have discovered a way to fix it. To bend time itself to my whims.” \n“Time is not something to be tampered with,” Strange replied. “The cost is far too high. You know that.” \n“But what if the reward were even greater?” Doom continued. “I’m on the verge of something magnificent, Stephen. And you hold the key to my success.”\n“What’s this chrome-plated crackpot yappin’ about?!” Bats asked, clearly growing more impatient with every second. \n“Victor has long sought to undo some critical mistakes that led him down his current path,” Strange said. \n“Doom does not make mistakes,” the visitor replied sternly. “However… there were certain steps along my journey that, if retread, could lead to possibilities that currently lie beyond my grasp. Tell me, Stephen, have you not ever wished to rewind the clock?” \nStrange paused, looking down at his mangled hands, wondering how his life might have unfolded had he not been in the accident that had forced him to go from renowned surgeon to reclusive sorcerer. But as the Ancient One had taught him, fate was not in the hands of any mortal, even those with unparalleled mystical might.\n“I have become who I am supposed to be, Victor,” Strange said. “My journey would have ended in the same place, no matter the road taken.”\n“I wish to prove otherwise,” Doom replied. “And to do so, all I require is a single spell.” \n“The fact that you do not already have access to the spell you seek speaks volumes,” Strange said, raising a curious eyebrow. “There are few arcane rites unknown to a sorcerer of your esteem. Perhaps just the forbidden spells inscribed on the pages of — ” \n“The Darkhold,” Doom said. \nStephen Strange shuddered at the name. The Darkhold was a cursed collection of insidious incantations, said to be authored by an elder god of chaos known as Chthon. This so-called Book of Sins had a corrupting effect on those who dared to tap into its mystic malevolence. Strange had recovered the illicit text from the Dark Dimension long ago after a battle against his rival, Baron Mordo, and had stored it within his Sanctum Sanctorum for safekeeping ever since. \n“I’m afraid that volume is off limits, old friend,” Strange said resolutely. “Which of those Chthonic curses could possibly aid you in your endeavors anyway?” \n“The Vampiric Verses,” Doom whispered, almost as if speaking the spell’s name aloud was enough to unleash its terror upon the world. \n“Hold on…” Bats interrupted. “You want to turn yourself into a vampire? Ain’t you already spooky enough, fella?!” \n“I wish no such thing,” Doom said, his patience beginning to crumble away. “But Dracula and his immortal legion used this same rite centuries ago to successfully cheat time. Perhaps, with the proper amount of scrutiny, I can do the same and unlock the secrets of time's true nature.” \n“An interesting approach…” Strange said, “…but one far too risky for me to allow. I’m sorry, Victor, but the answer is ‘no.’”\n“I was afraid you would say that… ‘old friend,’” Doom responded. “But I will have what I seek, even if I must take it from you by force.” \nWithout a moment’s notice, Doom conjured up the Veil of Khonshu, sending a massive wave of darkness cascading towards Strange. \n“Claws of Bast!” Strange commanded, slashing through the oncoming wall of ebony energy with brightly-glowing purple claws that were forged from spirit energy drawn directly from the Wakandan ancestral plane, Djalia. \n“Impressive, Stephen,” Doom replied, circling his arms in a frenzied motion. “But can you weather the Mists of Fimbulwinter?”\nA freezing gust of wind rushed from the magical circle Doom had conjured. But Stephen Strange was not willing to back down, even as the bitter frost stiffened his cape. \n“I’ve spent winters in Kamar-Taj,” Strange mused. “This is nothing.” \nDoom watched in surprise as Doctor Strange fought through the icy gusts to cast his next incantation. Even more shockingly, each of the Sorcerer Supreme’s hands seemed to be conjuring their own spells, entirely independent of each other. One blazed a bright red while the other glistened gold. As Strange brought his hands together, he released an enchantment that even he had never summoned before, born from the combined energy of both the Crimson Cosmos and Asgard:\n“Crimson Thorns of Yggdrasil!” \nLong, spiked vines erupted forth from Strange’s hands, glowing a deep scarlet as they whipped towards their intended target. Before Doom could even think to utter a defensive spell, he found himself completely ensnared by the thorny limbs, unable to move. \n“You seem to have forgotten that I am far more powerful when within my own home,” Strange said. \n“For a guy who doesn’t make mistakes, Doom,” Bats added, “that was a pretty big one.” \n“Perhaps I was too rash in my actions,” Doom responded. “Release me from these shackles, Stephen, and I assure you I will depart your home in peace.”\n“You ain’t really gonna trust this guy, are ya, Doc?” Bats asked with deep concern. \n“I am,” Strange replied, lowering his hands and releasing the spell’s grip on Doom. “Victor and I may have different goals and opinions when it comes to sorcery, but he has always been a man of his word.”\n“Indeed,” Doom said as he began to walk from Strange’s inner sanctum. “And you also have my word, Stephen, that I will find a way to finally break the bonds of time. With your help… or without…” \n“And you have my word,” Strange warned, “that, should you overstep your station, the Sorcerer Supreme will do whatever it takes to stop you.” \n“Now get outta here before we find out just how bite-proof that tacky armor of yours really is!” Bats yowled. \n“No one speaks to Doom like that, mutt!” Doom snarled back. “You should consider yourself lucky that you are already deceased.”\n“Guess there’s a first time for everything,” Bats responded wryly. \n“Before I go, Stephen…” Doom said, looking back over his shoulder at Strange, “…a warning. I have foreseen a great evil coming to this city you call home. You may be safe within your House of Truth for now, but those outside its walls will soon be Drowning in darkness.”\n“What the hell is that supposed to mean?” Bats barked toward the darkened doorway as Doom faded into the shadows.\n“Easy, boy. He’s already gone,” Strange replied. “But I have an uneasy feeling that we’ll find out what Victor was talking about soon enough. So… if you’ll excuse me…” \nWith a simple gesture of one hand, Doctor Strange opened a sparkling portal to a hidden corner of the Astral Plane, one so remote that even he barely knew where it was located. With a wave of his other hand, the Darkhold flew off his bookshelf and into the rift. The extra-dimensional gateway quickly closed as soon as the ancient tome passed safely through, as if it neither the portal nor the book had ever existed in the first place. \n“For safekeeping,” Strange said, almost as if reassuring himself. “Doom will never find the Darkhold there.” \n“I just hope he’s the only one looking for it…” said Bats. \n“You and I both, my friend…” Strange mused, turning his attention back to the far-less-dangerous spell book that he had been studying when his unexpected guest first arrived. \nAs Bats curled up on the floor of Doctor Strange’s study, the chill finally faded from Bleecker Street. Soon enough, the sun would rise again and its heat would saturate the city. If only the residents of Manhattan had known how few days of light and warmth they had left… \nA Few Months Later.\nStephen Strange sat in front of the large circular window on the upper level of his Sanctum Sanctorum, sipping on a cup of herbal tea. It had been some time since Victor Von Doom had paid him a visit, but the confrontation, while brief, had not left his thoughts. He often found himself wondering if Doom would succeed in his quest to conquer time itself. And this day, Strange would finally have his answer. \nEven before the blinding flash of light filled the sky, Strange could feel the massive disturbance rippling across the fabric of time and space itself. He didn’t know where it had originated, but he had a single educated guess: Latveria. \n“What have you done, Victor…?” Strange wondered aloud, as the disturbance spiraled wildly across the material plane. It pierced through dimensions — including the Astral Plane — and surged towards the Sanctum Sanctorum. \nStrange had only a fraction of a second to react to the oncoming wave of chronal chaos, but he knew that his next move could very well determine not only his fate, but the fate of countless universes as well. \nBoth as a surgeon and a sorcerer, Doctor Stephen Strange had faced countless life and death choices before… but never one quite as important as this…",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10200010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "The Collector found her in his Museum and asked her where she had come from.\nMantis did not know. One moment she had been with her fellow Guardians of the Galaxy and the next…\n“Fascinating,” the Collector said. “There is about to be a vacancy. I hope you last longer…”\nShe waited for her moment as the Collector fiddled with the displays in his new Theme Park. He readied an enclosure for his new guest, eager to display her to his audiences from inside a glass-walled tank. She would be featured prominently in a vast hall filled with other life forms the intergalactic Elder of the Universe found interesting. Many were humanoid, but the others ran the spectrum of physical shapes from globs of protoplasm to members of the Brood, their hive mind forcing a constant thrum in the back of Mantis’s mind. It was tough being a telepath sometimes, especially in the presence of so many fearful minds reaching out from their cages.\nOne of those minds was peculiar and interesting to her. Unlike the others, it was all excitement, emotions turned all the way up, like every thought it had ended in multiple exclamation points. He was full of a kind of joy that Mantis found infectious, even though she was held prisoner in a psychotic museum in deep space a thousand light-years from the nearest planet. \nJeff. Jeff!\nShe smiled at his name and thought, I would very much like to meet you, Jeff.\n!!!!!!!\nAnother mind, physically closer to Mantis, also drew her attention. A human woman whose mind teemed with memories of war. No, not human, but something close… She was a deadly warrior. Mantis, who knew a little something about being deadly herself, thought that if she ever managed to escape, she might enjoy taking the battlefield with this woman. She called herself after one of the weapons she wielded: Sai. But in her mind was a deeper name, one Mantis would have to ask if she ever got to talk with this warrior. \nThat’s far enough, get out.\nAnd with that, Mantis lost her connection to Sai. She was psionic, too, and her last thought screamed vengeance, so Mantis returned to listen to Jeff for a little additional dose of optimism.\nThere were so many others, but Mantis enjoyed the company of these two. Jeff because of his irrepressible joy, and the few bits of Sai she could latch onto, because she put Mantis in mind of escape… and revenge. Mantis started to form a plan. Well, another plan. She had been forming plans to escape practically since the moment she had arrived.\nThe other feature of this hall in the Theme Park was its garden. The Collector was not only interested in animal organisms. Huge trees, ferns, flowering vines, mosses and more bizarre forms of vegetation grew over and around the tanks containing the exhibits — including Mantis’s. Those plants would be her way out.\nFor a time, she had tried to use her telepathic powers to influence the Collector’s cleaning and maintenance staff or one of the guards to open her tank. Then, she had tried to use her powers over plants to get them to grow over to her tank and break it apart with their roots. Neither worked, and Mantis realized the Collector had built this tank to dampen her active psionic powers.\nShe had another option to escape, but it would be an act of desperation — and if the Collector had blocked it as well, Mantis didn't want to know that just yet.\nAfter what felt like weeks, though, he forced her hand.\nHer tank was wheeled into a large arena, and placed inside a larger transparent chamber. The stands were packed with spectators, the noise from their minds nearly intolerable to Mantis, filled with eager bloodlust she couldn’t shut out. She reached out, probing the barriers that imprisoned her and found that the Collector was still somehow blocking her telepathic powers.\nAnother tank came into the arena, and inside it was another Mantis. Even before their individual tanks dissolved and the Collector himself called out over the speaker system, Mantis understood what he wanted.\n“It seems I have another duplicate in my collections!” he proclaimed. “These infinite Mantises are intolerable! So again, my people, I have transformed this excess into entertainment. Two Mantises enter… one Mantis leaves!”\nThe crowd exploded with raucous cheers.\nThe other Mantis looked at her. How long had she been imprisoned here? Had she too tried to escape? Had anyone tried to rescue her? In this timeline, was she one of the Guardians of the Galaxy, or…? Mantis knew she would never know. She didn’t have time to find out, and she felt the waves of anguish and desperation radiating from the other Mantis. There was no barrier between them. Mantis tried to calm her, but the frenzied crowd made that impossible. She steeled herself to fight, but then the other Mantis broke through, speaking directly into her mind.\nI can’t do this anymore.\nMantis couldn’t help her response: Two of us enter…\n…One leaves, the other finished. You. Then the Collector will have no Mantises, as it should be.\nWhat?\nThe mind of the other-dimensional doppelganger radiated an exhaustion and despair so intense that Mantis almost tried to break off their connection. But she couldn’t. One curse of being a telepath is you always felt like you owe someone your attention, since you spend so much time sneaking around in their mind. \nYou can go. You just have to leave your body behind. I’ll help.\nNo, we can go together —\nWe can’t. I don’t have the strength. I can push you along a little, but I can’t pull myself out of here. Too many battles… just too much…\nThe other Mantis’s attention wavered, and Mantis realized she was only going to get one chance at this. She had to take it before the other Mantis faded away.\nGrateful for the other Mantis’s sacrifice, Mantis gathered her mind and focused on the shimmering essence of the astral plane, unseen but omnipresent. She felt a tinge of remorse. She would miss this body… but she had missed all the others she had worn before it, too. Now was her chance. \nShe felt the other Mantis pouring energy into the link Mantis was building to the astral plane. The link would only hold for a short time before the Collector detected and severed it. \nGo, the other Mantis said. I can’t do this for long.\nYou win, Mantis told her other self — and with a sob, she let her body go. \nOne Mantis leaves, she thought… and it was going to be her.\nDo me a favor, the other Mantis said as her consciousness faded away. Come back to this place someday… and make the Collector pay for what he’s done... \nIn the astral plane, the Collector’s Theme Park was a scintillating stew of thoughts and emotions, emanating from hundreds of different life forms. Mantis floated free of her enclosure and dove into a thicket of alien plant life, feeling the sensation of the vegetative consciousness enclosing her. She greeted the plants and made her request. In a rustle of leaves and a twitch of vines, they agreed.\nFrom the cells of vine and flower, branch and bark, Mantis built herself a new body and sank into it from the astral plane. It was a draining process, but also a thrill as she felt her physical self become real again. She thanked the plants, and they rustled their acknowledgement. \nAll right, Collector, she thought. Now we’ll see what happens when one of your prize exhibits gets loose.\nWhen she stepped from the garden, fully formed and Mantis again, alarms were shrieking. The Collector was onto her. She had already figured out which way the hangar was, where the Collector’s huge fleet of spacecraft were docked, but she had something else she needed to do first. \nNavigating through the Collector’s Museum, Mantis got close to the spot where her old enclosure had once been. Across the gallery, Sai stood in her own cage looked back at Mantis. Didn’t call out, didn’t ask for help. Just looked.\nMantis ran to Sai’s cage, knowing she didn’t have much time. The Collector’s guards wouldn’t be looking for her here at first, but they would get around to it sooner or later. \n“Your name is Sai, right?” Mantis asked.\nThe woman in the cage glared back at Mantis with curiosity. \n“You cut me out of your head,” Mantis said, “but you never left my thoughts. Would you like to get out of here? We might have to fight.”\nSai smiled a smile as thin and deadly as her blades.\nAt that moment one of the Collector’s guards lumbered around the corner and caught sight of Mantis. The guard, a massive humanoid with tusks and a clubbed tail, did a double-take. He was transporting a glass enclosure with Mantis’s previous, lifeless body within it. \n“What the —?!” the confused guard exclaimed.\nHe never got a chance to finish his thought. Mantis leapt into a spinning kick that snapped the guard’s head back. Before he could recover, she kicked his legs out from under him and landed an elbow in the middle of his forehead. As he hit the ground, she gave him a little telepathic encouragement to stay down. His agonized grimace turned into a sleepy, peaceful smile.\n“Nice,” Sai said as Mantis opened her cage and set her free. “But not permanent enough.”\nAs another group of guards ran down the hall, Sai leapt into action. Her abilities no longer dampened by the enclosure, she manifested a sword made of pure psionic energy and began slashing at the guards with deadly precision. Each cut set her foes’ synapses ablaze. Sai stood over one of the fallen guards and raised her blade high, ready to deliver a lethal strike. But she stopped when Mantis put a hand gently on her shoulder. \n“It doesn’t need to be permanent” Mantis said, already moving down the hall and beckoning for Sai to follow her. “It just has to last until we’re gone.”\nSai looked down at the guard for a moment. In her old life, back in the Demon days, she would not have shown such mercy. But this was a strange new world she found herself in. Sai took a deep breath, let the psionic blade fade from her hands, then turned and followed Mantis deeper into the Collector’s compound. \n“How can you be certain we are headed in the right direction?” Sai asked as she kept pace with her liberator. “This citadel is like a maze.”\n“The guards know their way around,” Mantis said. “So I borrowed a map from one of their minds.” \n“Clever,” Sai said. \n“There should be a hangar straight ahead,” Mantis continued. “We’ll be able to find a ship there.” \n“Then why are we turning left?” Sai asked, confused by the sudden diversion in their path..\n“There’s someone else we have to get first,” Mantis told her new friend.\n“Who?” Sai asked.\nMantis wasn’t exactly sure how to answer. \n“Someone else that I heard in my head,” she said. “His name is Jeff. He’s… different…”\n“We don’t have time,” Sai said.\n“I had time for you,” Mantis said. “I’m not leaving him here.”\nSai held her gaze for a long moment, then rolled her eyes and gave up. “Then let’s make it fast.”\nMantis was already moving, homing in on the unmistakable psionic sensation of Jeff’s mind. She picked up the pace, dodging a patrol of the Collector’s guards, and sensed that Jeff was just up ahead, in the —\n“MMMRRRAAARRRR!!!!”\nHe saw her and a huge grin spread over his face. A really huge grin. Filled with several rows of serrated teeth. \n“Jeff…?” Mantis couldn’t quite believe what she saw.\nThe strange little creature swam excitedly to the glass wall of his water-filled tank and pressed his stubby nose against it. What kind of creature was this? Mantis had seen sharks in her previous time on Earth, but this was a shark with… legs?\n“MMMRRRRR!!!!”\n“He’s going to draw the guards,” Sai said, her jaw tight. \nMantis smiled despite everything. She and her new friends were on the run inside the Collector’s Museum, with no idea how to get or where they would go if they did get off — yet there was something about them both that made her smile, like she knew deep down that everything was going to be all right.

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10210010_HeroGalleryInfo_Story_#0_Content": "All Hawkeye knew when he got on board the Quinjet was that he was heading out on a solo rescue mission and it involved Hydra. That suited him. Extended mission prep wasn't really his style. You only needed a certain amount of information to take a smart approach; overpreparation could dull your senses, keep you from being aware and responsive when things changed in the field. As they always did. No plan survived contact with the enemy for long. For the first hour or so, as the craft arrowed south from a Helicarrier stationed just above of the big island of Hawaii, Clint kept to himself, watching the water go by. He'd never been a sparkling conversationalist, so silence suited him. \n\"How you doing back there, stranger?\" Agent 13 shouted back from her seat at the controls. Clint had nearly forgotten she was there after two hours or so staring into the endless blue expanse of the Pacific. Clint decided it was time to make some conversation. \"So-so. We headed to Antarctica or what?\"\n\"Bingo,\" Agent 13 said. \"Although it doesn't take a genius to figure out that if you go south from Hawaii, you hit either New Zealand or Antarctica.\"\n\"Never said I was a genius, but I can read a map.\" Clint got up from his seat and started arranging his gear on a worktable: Bow, arrows, swords, body armor, comms equipment, night vision goggles, emergency field rations. Then he broke open the kit bag with his name on it and found cold-weather gear. \"So, let me guess. You want me to stop Hydra poaching dinosaurs in the Savage Land.\"\n\"You wouldn't need cold-weather gear for that.\"\n\"I would until I got there, unless you're going to fly me to the border and risk Sauron sending a million pterodactyls after this Quinjet.\"\n\"No Savage Land for you, Hawkeye,\" Agent 13 said. \"We are in fact going to Ross Island, which is only technically an island because it's connected to the mainland of Antarctica by a two-mile thick sheet of ice.\"\n\"Yeah, the Ross Ice Shelf. I've heard of it.\" \n\"The target is a Hydra base on Ross Island. More specifically, the target is Bucky Barnes.\"\n\"Don't tell me,\" Clint said, as a cold knot formed in the pit of his stomach. Bucky had worked so hard to get free of the brainwashing he'd suffered after World War II. What a terrible thing it would be if he'd been mind-controlled again. Clint thought hard about whether he'd be able to follow through on a mission to eliminate Bucky Barnes. He'd done worse during his Ronin years, but he'd also left Ronin behind. He was Hawkeye again. He was an Avenger. \n\"It's not what you think, judging by the expression on your face,\" Agent 13 said. \"Three days ago, Barnes was sent to infiltrate and gather intel about Hydra activity inside Charteris Mount. Infiltration was successful and we got some brief communications from Bucky during the mission's first few hours, but as of eight hours after infiltration, comms were interrupted and we presume he's been a Hydra captive since then.\"\nAnything could have happened to Bucky in three days, Clint thought. But he was tough, as tough as anybody, and if there was a chance to get him out alive, that's what Clint would do. \"Why Charteris Mount?\"\n\"Well, because it's tunneled into Erebus Ice Shelf. But Hydra probably also likes the mythological associations.\"\n\"You gonna make me ask?\"\n\"I thought you'd never ask,\" she said. \"In Greek mythology, Erebus was the son of Chaos and one of the primordial gods. Also, that's the name the Greeks gave to the gate between the world of the living and the underworld.\"\n\"Yeah, Hydra would go for that.\"\n\"Behind every myth is a bit of truth. Some of Bucky's comms were pretty scrambled, but we have a basic idea that the base is built on a much older set of ruins. It's likely there's an occult angle.\"\n\"An occult angle,\" Clint repeated. \"So, like, I should expect to run into monsters from the Greek underworld?\"\n\"That's all I can tell you. Also, they're doing some kind of super-soldier research. Bucky was loud and clear about that.\"\nClint thought about this while he got just the edge he wanted on his twin swords. He sheathed them and selected his arrowheads, going with a standard assortment of explosive, nonlethal, and ordinary bladed tips. He felt a pre-mission calm descend over him, and that was good. That hadn't happened much while he was Ronin.\n\"So,\" Agent 13 said from the cockpit. \"You ready?\"\n\"For this mission, or to be an Avenger again?\"\nShe chucked him on the shoulder. \"Once an Avenger, always an Avenger. I was talking about the mission.\"\nOnce an Avenger, always an Avenger. Clint wasn't sure about that. \nThen again, even when he was an Avenger, he hadn't always felt like one. It wasn't easy feeling like you were an equal member of a team when all you could do was shoot a bow and the other team members could call lightning or lift a hundred tons.\nIf he was being honest with himself, that was why he'd left. That was why he'd become Ronin.\nThe thing was, once you'd been a hero — an Avenger — and once you understood how powerful it could be to change things, to make things better with your own hands... you couldn't just stop caring. Or maybe some people could, but Clint couldn't. So he stopped being Hawkeye, and he adopted a new moniker: Ronin. A samurai with no master. He kept an eye out for situations that might need his help. He trained in some new ways of fighting. He reinvented himself. For a couple of years, he'd been doing things the Avengers would never have noticed. Street-level, local things. More like Spider-Man might do. Then that expanded into bigger-scale operations, against drug kingpins, human traffickers, the kind of people normal law enforcement couldn't get to and Super Heroes didn't notice because they were too busy fighting Thanos or Dormammu or Doctor Doom. \nRonin traveled the world, and by and large, he made it a better place. There were a lot of people alive because of Ronin, but there were also a lot of people that never got back up. Bad people? Sure. But one night, in a mansion high above the smoggy sprawl of Istanbul where he'd just eliminated an arms trafficker and his entire armed retinue of maybe twenty bodyguards, Clint realized he'd stopped holding himself to any standard beyond what he thought was right. He was very close to going off the rails, becoming a pure vigilante nut like Frank Castle. It was only a few steps from there to the kind of deluded villain who thought he was doing the world a favor, a Vulture or Killmonger. \nHe needed people around him to keep him on track, and the only people who could do that were the Avengers.\nSo he'd come home, picking up the Hawkeye mantle yet again — but with a few changes, traces of Ronin that he would always carry with him. Maybe someday he would be free of the guilt he still carried over some of the things he'd done. He'd never hurt anyone he considered innocent, but, in the heat of battle, sometimes you couldn't tell who was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nThe moral clarity of a fight against Hydra was something Clint Barton badly needed.\n\"Okay. We're five minutes out. Time for last-minute notes. You'll find a vehicle stashed near your landing site. Its beacon will activate once it detects you on the ground.\"\n\"Hope you left the keys in the ignition,\" Clint said. \nIgnoring him, she went on. \"There is a large hangar bay with several doors built into the flank of the mountain. That's the only obvious approach without using demolitions to get into one of the lower access shafts. Intel recommends you stay on the upper levels because honestly, we have no idea what's down below.\"\n\"Monsters,\" Clint said. \"Got it.\"\nAgent 13 shrugged. \"Probably not? But you never know. Get in, get Barnes, and get out. If Barnes is...\" She hesitated. \"If Barnes can't be recovered, your priority is to get the info and get out yourself.\"\n\"You mean if he's dead. Just say it.\"\nHer eyes flashed. \"Yes. If he's dead,\" she said, biting off each word. Turning her back on him, she went back to the cockpit. Clint stayed where he was, in the back of the cabin, alone with his thoughts. Which was never the healthiest place for him to be.\nWhat if Bucky was...gone...again? Mind-controlled again?\nDeep inside, Clint felt a Ronin-like cold certainty that he would know what to do. \nNo. Bucky would survive. Hawkeye would find him. Not Ronin. Hawkeye. Tomorrow morning, they would both be watching the sun rise as Agent 13 piloted them back toward Hawaii. \n\"We are in the drop zone,\" Agent 13 said calmly. \"Will open the cargo door on your go.\"\n\"Go,\" Clint said. \nThe Antarctic wind stole the air from his lungs. Clint steadied himself, got a bead on the ground, and jumped.",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10220000_HeroGalleryInfo_Story_#0_Content": "Steve Rogers was a man out of time. A man out of space. And, perhaps for the first time ever, a man out of his depth. \nWhat he had experienced over these last few weeks had made the epic adventures he’d lived through during World War II seem normal and mundane. Steve stood on a balcony, gazing out over the spaceport of the futuristic city in front of him, wondering why the universe had chosen to bring him back here and now after so many years away. He didn’t know the answer yet, but he knew deep down there had to be a reason. There always was. \n“A penny for your thoughts, old man?” a voice said, approaching from behind. Steve turned to see Clint Barton, the archer known as Hawkeye, joining him. \nSteve gazed past Clint and caught a glimpse of his old partner, James “Bucky” Barnes, lying deathly still inside of a high-tech medical scanner as scientists and physicians tended to his wounds. It was clear that Bucky was no longer the plucky teen sidekick who had never strayed from Captain America’s side during the war. He had grown into his own man… but far more than that. He was now a skilled assassin with a cybernetic arm and a tortured past, developments Steve had missed while he was frozen inside a chunk of ice for the last century or so. During that time, Bucky had become the Winter Soldier, and Steve wasn’t sure just how much of the boy he once knew still remained. Especially after what Hydra had just done to him…\n“Just thinking about how much has changed,” Steve replied. \n“I hear ya,” Clint agreed. “Speaking of which… When are you finally gonna tell me why you brought us to this crazy interstellar version of Wakanda? Or, you know, how you’re still alive? Because, as far as I remember, Captain America fell in the line of duty…” \n“Now’s as good a time as any, I suppose,” Steve said, realizing that this was the first real downtime he’d had since he’d brought Clint and Bucky into his strange new world. Steve took a deep breath before he began to tell his tale. \nHe started by regaling Clint with the story of his final mission during the war, when the plane he was on crashed into the Arctic Ocean. As the plane filled with water, he could feel his muscles freezing, his heartbeat slowing, his vision blurring to white. And then… nothing… for what seemed like an eternity. He didn’t know if he was alive or dead until he found himself trapped inside of a glass tube, freshly thawed out of a chunk of ice by a beautiful redhead with the slightest hint of a Russian accent. \n“Natasha?!” Clint exclaimed. \nSteve could tell by his new friend’s reaction that he had history with this mystery woman. He wanted to ask Clint who she was, how he knew her, why she would have rescued him, and where she could be found now. But those questions would have to wait until after his story was done. \nSteve continued, telling how he and Natasha had escaped from the Alchemax lab together, only to be caught in a massive explosion before they could reach safety. Steve protected Natasha from the detonation, but quickly realized that his continued presence would only put a target on her head. So he decided to disappear.\nWith the help of a tough-as-nails Resistance soldier named Logan, Steve found his way to the embassy of a nation whose king he had befriended during the war. If anyone could provide him a safe haven until he got his bearings, he imagined it would be the isolationist African nation of Wakanda. But when Steve and Logan arrived at the Wakandan Embassy, it looked as though it had been abandoned for years. All that remained were the silent statues of former Black Panthers guarding their nation’s proud legacy.  \nExamining the statue of Bashenga — the first Black Panther — Steve took note of the inscription on its base: Since the birth of this nation, our people have reached for the stars. At last, we have found them.\nSteve didn’t know what that meant, but he would find out when Logan activated the high-tech Kimoyo bead given to them by their Resistance allies. A strange portal opened next to the sculpture of Bashenga, and Steve stepped through. In the blink of an eye, he arrived on the other side of the universe, finding himself in a city so advanced that it seemed like something straight from one of those science-fiction serials the boys at Camp Lehigh loved to watch on their nights off. This was the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. And its monarch was waiting for him. \nKing T’Challa and his sister Shuri welcomed Steve with open arms, offering him a safe place to stay and full access to their technology. T’Challa shared stories that his father had passed down to him about his trusted ally in star-spangled armor. Shuri even crafted a new shield forged from Vibranium alloy, just like the one Steve had carried during the war. With a few perks of course.\nAs Steve searched for more answers about this new world — a world where it was no longer 1945, but instead, the year 2099 — what he found was more unsettling than he had originally realized. The future he had awoken in was just one of many — an endless collection of possible timelines that were currently in the process of collapsing on each other due to a phenomenon known as the Timestream Entanglement. \nT’Challa and Shuri had already reached out to scientists and heroes from other realities in hopes of finding a way to repair the timelines, but the process was beginning to lead to conflicts between groups with disparate goals and methods. T’Challa knew that the time would eventually come where the heroes would have to confront not only the darkness that loomed on the horizon, but perhaps each other as well. And so he asked Steve a favor: To gather the very best soldiers from across time and space and bring them into their fold. When Steve agreed, there was no doubt whose name would be first on his list. \n“And I’m flattered, Cap,” Clint said with his trademark smirk. “Really.”\n“It was Bucky I was after,” Steve admitted, missing Clint’s sarcasm, “but I’m not complaining that you happened to come along for the ride. He says you’re one of the good ones.” \nTruthfully, Hawkeye couldn’t even dream of being insulted that he wasn’t Cap’s first pick. After all, this clearly wasn’t the same version of Steve Rogers that he’d served alongside on the Avengers for so many years. That Steve had died trying to save the world. The Steve in front of him now didn’t even know that Hawkeye existed until a few days ago, when he jumped through time and space to save Clint and Bucky from certain death in the depths of a crumbling Hydra base before bringing them back to this bizarre future. \n“You know who else is one of the good ones?” Hawkeye asked, growing a bit weary of the history lesson. “Nat. If she’s still around in this weird world of yours, we probably ought to track her down. I’m sure Bucky would tell you the same if he wasn’t currently out cold…”\nAs if on cue, Steve and Clint heard a commotion behind them. They turned to see Bucky, who was now standing next to the med-station that he’d been lying in moments earlier. Wakandan doctors scurried about, not sure how their patient could possibly be on his feet in his condition. \n“Steve…” Bucky said, straining to form words as he leaned against the scanner to steady himself. Something was wrong. \n“What is it, partner?” Steve asked with concern. Even though this wasn’t technically the Bucky he had known his whole life, Steve could still see as clear as day that his friend was struggling.\n“Not feeling so good…” Bucky said. “It’s like… someone is whispering in my brain…”\n“Oh, no,” Clint said. “Some sort of Hydra conditioning?” \n“No… Not Hydra…” Bucky responded, every word dripping with pain. “It’s something older… Darker…”\nSteve and Clint glanced over at a nearby statue of Bast, the panther goddess worshipped by the Wakandan people, and realized that its eyes had begun to radiate a deep red. \n“That can’t be good,” Clint mused. \n“Not at all,” Steve agreed. \nAs Bucky writhed in pain, his eyes began to glow the same red as the statue’s. A cluster of organic tentacles started to rapidly grow from the place where his brand new cybernetic arm met his shoulder. They intertwined with the technology of the artificial limb, seeming to integrate into it as they transformed the arm into something new entirely. Bucky let out a scream as the snake-like limbs extended from the end of the arm and flailed about wildly, striking towards Steve and Clint. \n“I thought I cut those things off!” Clint yelled as he dodged out of the way. \n“It didn’t take,” Steve said, blocking the whipping appendages with his shield to prevent them from striking a Wakandan scientist. “Innocents are in danger here. Let’s take this battle somewhere more open.”  \nWithout another word, Steve and Clint both ran at full speed toward the edge of the balcony and leapt down several floors to the spaceport below. Landing safely, they looked up and saw that the Winter Soldier was in hot pursuit, just as they had hoped. \n“We need to get to the palace and alert T’Challa and Shuri,” Steve said. “Clint, think you can you pilot a Wakandan starship?” \n“I can pilot anything,” Clint said with a wide grin. He ran over to one of the Wakandan crafts and leapt into the cockpit with the grace and skill of a circus acrobat. With the flick of a few switches, the ship started to rise into the air. But before it could depart toward the Wakandan palace, it was ensnared by the tentacles extending from Bucky’s arm. \nClint hit the thrusters, but the tentacles held the ship in midair. Bucky didn’t even budge, somehow drawing an intense amount of superhuman strength from the dark force possessing him. \nSuddenly, Captain America’s shield ricocheted through the spaceport, gaining momentum with each bounce before finally slicing the tentacles in twain and forcing Bucky to release his grip on the ship. As Clint jetted off toward safer skies, Steve heroically leapt up and caught his shield in midair. \n“Snap out of it, Bucky,” Steve said as he landed back on the ground, shield at the ready. \n“No,” Bucky replied. As he instinctively retracted the wounded tentacles back into his body, they once again seemed to merge with the technology of his cybernetic arm. \nKnowing that there was no other option, Steve raced toward Bucky, ready to face the unexpected threat head on. Bucky matched Steve’s sprint and rushed at his former partner, leaping into the air and raising his bionic fist, ready to strike. Steve hoisted his shield, blocking the blow. The impact of Vibranium on Vibranium sent a shockwave through the spaceport that shattered every window in a 100 meter radius. \nThe clash that followed felt longer than World War II, at least to Steve. The two soldiers knew each other so well that neither could get a hit in that wasn’t instantly blocked and countered. Despite their effort, they were getting nowhere. And while Steve Rogers knew he could do this all day, he wasn’t sure how much longer Bucky could survive the dark forces that had taken control of him. \n“Looks like you could use the cavalry, Cap,” Clint yelled out as he landed his spacecraft on the nearby launch pad. As he exited the cockpit, Steve realized that his new friend hadn’t come alone. With him was Princess Shuri, one of Wakanda’s most brilliant scientists and the designer of Bucky’s new cybernetic arm. \n“I have good news and bad, Captain,” Shuri said, extending her arm to reveal her bracelet made of high-tech Kimoyo beads. As she touched one of the beads, a hologram of Bucky’s arm appeared in the air. “The cybernetic limb I created for your friend is made from a number of bleeding-edge materials, including Vibranium, nanotech, and Unstable Molecules.” \n“Is that the good news or the bad?” Steve asked, unfamiliar with anything other than Vibranium. \n“It is both,” Shuri responded. “These technologies are all extremely adaptable, which may be the reason the limb has so easily accepted the unexpected additions to your friend’s physiology.” \n“That all sounds like bad news to me,” Steve said. \n“Ah, but those technologies also have a memory,” Shuri continued. “They work in unison to sync to the host’s unique internal energy signature. When that energy becomes corrupted, the limb can be used to recalibrate the internal systems of the person wearing it.” \n“In other words, we can restore Bucky to factory settings,” Clint added. \n“How do we do that?” asked Steve. \n“The procedure requires a manual reset,” Shuri responded. “However, the likelihood that Bucky will allow you to get close enough to perform one seems slim.” \n“I don’t need to get close,” Clint said. “Just keep him busy, Cap, and I’ll show you why you made me an Avenger.” \nSteve called out to Bucky, getting his partner’s full attention. This time, instead of engaging his opponent directly, Steve kept his distance, dodging and weaving along the edge of the spaceport. Bucky frantically lashed out at him, narrowly missing with every strike. \nMeanwhile, Shuri attached a Kimoyo bead to the head of one of Hawkeye’s arrows. The bead, programmed with a kill code that would initiate a forced reboot of the arm’s operating systems, would have to hit a one millimeter target located on the back of Bucky’s shoulder. Clint would only have one shot. Luckily, that’s all he ever needed. \nClint nocked his arrow and watched carefully as Bucky swung at Steve, over and over. He waited patiently until his target was in the perfect position. Then he released the arrow, letting it soar toward Bucky’s shoulder — a perfect hit! \nThe cybernetic arm instantly shut down and the tentacles, which had been flailing madly, dropped limp to Bucky’s side. Bucky staggered for a moment and then fell to his knees. Steve and Clint both raced to their friend’s side. \n“Sorry… about that…” Bucky said, regaining his composure. “Don’t know… what came over me…” \n“Neither do I,” Shuri said, joining the trio of heroes, “but I think it would be worth running some tests.  I already have some ideas as to how we can get your newfound talents under control and repurpose the strange energy flowing through you…” \n“Great…” Bucky said. “More experiments…” \n“Don’t worry, partner,” Steve said, leading Bucky toward the spacecraft so that he could be transported back to Shuri’s lab. “Whatever this is, you’re not going through it alone. Not ever again.”\n“I’m glad to have you back, Steve,” Bucky said, offering a faint smile as his strength started to return. \nSteve proudly looked at his new allies, the brave soldiers he had gathered. Even after the chaos that had just occurred, there still wasn’t anyone else he’d rather have by his side to face the unexpected challenges ahead. \n“I’m glad to be back,” Steve Rogers said. And for the first time since he had awoken in this strange new world, he truly meant it.",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10230010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "After Quill went and crashed the Milano — because he wasn’t paying attention to what Rocket was telling him, naturally — Rocket had noted that they were in the middle of what looked like a huge ship graveyard. Great, he thought. Let me go find parts, get the Milano patched up, and we’ll be out of there in no time. \nSo that’s what he was doing, only most of the ships were so old that they didn’t have anything useful for the Milano. He’d marked a few that might be worth closer attention, but mostly Rocket was not finding what he needed in this massive junkyard. \n“Figures,” he said to nobody in particular. “Looks like I’m gonna have to engineer something tricky.”\nThere was movement among the hulks of ships off to his left. Rocket watched, but he didn’t see anything else. This Klyntar place had a strange vibe: Big spaceship boneyard, big monumental spooky ruins, all of it surrounded by a jungle made of the weirdest plants Rocket had seen on any planet. No visible sentient life, but all the same he felt like he was being watched. Also, there was a huge fire burning at one end of the boneyard, not too far from where Quill had crashed the Milano. Rocket considered checking back with the group before he explored much more...but nah. He could handle whatever came up. He sure didn’t need Quill, and Groot had said something about bonding with the local plants. Let him. Weirdo.\nUh oh. More movement. \nThey came out of the shadows so smoothly that for a moment, Rocket thought they were shadows. Then their motion gave them shape, silhouetted against the background of the spreading fire. Strange, elongated black life forms, no two the same except for their long teeth and claws. They sprang from the wrecked ships toward Rocket, but he didn’t waste any time. He racked his blaster and started shooting, running as he went. \nHe’d taken off in a more or less random direction, firing as he went to keep the monsters away, but ahead he saw a complex of buildings, in a weird monumental style that made him want to do literally anything other than go inside. But more and more of the toothy black monsters were hot on his tail, and Rocket prided himself on having better than average common sense, so he headed for the buildings, hoping to barricade a door, maybe. Anything to keep them out.\nRight before he got to the doorway, Rocket dropped a miniature gravity well behind him. He had been toying with black hole tech for a bit and the temporary void annihilated the closest monsters, buying him enough time to get inside the building and jam the door with various bits of debris — and a weird-looking statue he knocked over and shoved in front of the doorway. \nOkay, he thought. The monsters started to bang and scratch at the door. They weren’t getting in at the moment, but he wouldn’t have all day to execute the plan he hadn’t yet come up with.\nSo, he had to do a little scouting, see what he had to work with, but not waste any time. \nAs it turned out, quite a bit of scouting was required. Whoever had used these buildings, they had been very much into weapons and containment technology. This, Rocket reasoned, meant that it must have been some kind of jail, maybe? Or maybe they were trying to contain the living goo he had just escaped. Whatever its former use, he was going to turn it into a little fortress until such time as Groot and Quill decided to come looking for him. \nHis ears remained perked and alert, as he expected some of the monsters were in the building with him. This helped him dodge the blast from a wall turret as Rocket was trying to strip some quantum circuits out of a panel way down at the end of a long dark hall. He was so focused on what he was doing that he didn’t even hear the self-defense mechanism arm itself, only jumping backwards a moment before it fried him. He looked back to his score, a fresh new hole in the quantum circuit cluster he was attempting to pry out. “I was looting that!” Rocket shouted at the inanimate object. Only the turret wasn’t there anymore, smashed to bits by one of the creatures he was expecting.\nThe creature snarled back, and Rocket blew it away. In the darkness, he heard others moving and breathing. “Spooky,” he said. “Remind me not to book the reunion here.” He was talking just to hear his own voice, and keep himself calm while he figured out what to do. Truth was, only one course of action made sense. He couldn’t go back outside, so if he had to stay inside that meant getting rid of all the monsters, or activating the rest of the tech. \nRocket looked up and down the long corridor, noting how many side passages and intersections he could see. “Nah, too open.” He thought back to the building’s entrance. Just off the big front door, there was a smaller side room. It only had one door, and if he had oriented himself right, one of its walls was an exterior wall. So, if the monsters got in, he could always blast his way out through the wall. If he could retrofit the defense system before it took him out. \nNot the best plan in the world, but it would do for now.\nHe zig-zagged along the passages back to the front of the complex, slowed down a bit by all the gear he was dragging. A monster flashed out of a side passage, but Rocket had smelled it a split second before. Another one dropped from the ceiling, but Rocket’s whiskers sensed the disturbance in the air. Again, he was ready. His blaster lit up the darkened halls every time one of the monsters got near. The closest one of them got to him was a weird crab-looking version that ripped some hairs out of his tail before Rocket reduced it to a puddle of goo. \nThen he stopped in his tracks. Right there in a doorway was an energy barrier projector. Like the kind you might set up in a Xandarian prison. Rocket knew a little bit about those. \n“Aw yeah,” he said, ducking into the room and keeping his ears perked up while he fiddled with the barrier projector’s control panel. He was close to the entrance, close enough to hear the other monsters snarling outside the front door. This little room would be a perfect citadel, if he could get the other bits of the self-defense system online.\nOne of the monsters loomed out of the darkness. Rocket dropped his tools and blazed away at it until it was gone. Then he got back to work, knowing his time was running out. Kree, Shi’Ar, Skrull, Xandarian, so much tech had been retrofitted into this panel, Rocket was surprised it wasn’t his own invention. It looked like there wasn’t a power source but he had hotwired a few quantum circuits in his time. So he put the finishing touches into the console, paused to splatter another few monsters, and then hit the power button.\nAha! The energy barrier thrummed to life, with a few turrets in front of it, and because Rocket was exceedingly clever and also a little lucky, he was on the inside and the monsters were on the wrong end of a Kree turret. Just as an experiment, Rocket tried to shoot one of them through the barrier. Blam! It worked! \n“Aw, yeah,” he said again, louder this time, and then he was lighting them up through the barrier like there was no tomorrow. Which, if he didn’t figure out a way to get back to the Milano and get off this terrible monster rock, there wouldn’t be.\nHey, he thought. I bet I could use some of this stuff to reconstruct the containment fields in the Milano’s engines.\nThe idea lit up the inside of Rocket’s brain. He saw it all come together. It would totally work. All he had to do was get a plasma array, set of the couplings that would link it to the Milano’s magnetic field resonators, then wire the whole shebang into the acceleration chamber that was damaged when Quill crashed the Milano. Because, Rocket repeated in his mind, Quill was not listening to Rocket at the time. \nMore of the toothy black monsters that survived the turret onslaught threw themselves against the barrier. Rocket blazed away at them, and they fell back again. \nMan, he thought. This is a mighty elegant solution to a real tricky problem. Guess a few other unfortunate souls worked together to try and survive. But I guess whatever works... \nOnly problem was now, Rocket had to get out of the protected room, and the complex, with all the components.\nAnd that was going to require some finesse, because there were more of the monsters coming, and those doors weren’t going to hold forever. \nRocket racked a fresh charge into his gun, held it on the door, and waited.",

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10230_Story_#1_Content": "Rocket Raccoon understood why Jean Grey wasn’t exactly thrilled with his plan to defeat Knull. He had just informed her that she was going to have to sacrifice herself in order to make it work. When Jean asked to hear the full details of Rocket’s scheme before deciding to go along with it, it seemed only fair. And Rocket was more than glad to spell everything out if it helped her come to terms with her part in it. \n“A while back, my ship crashed into Klyntar and got stuck in the planet’s symbiotic surface,” Rocket said. “At first, I didn’t know how to get it out, but then I built a gizmo that worked on the same principle as Captain Marvel’s old Nega-Bands. It swapped the ship’s physical location with a Celestial Husk in orbit over Klyntar and — BOOM! — problem solved!” \n“Impressive…” Jean said, “…but how does that help us against Knull?” \nRocket rifled through a pouch on his uniform pulled out a pair of circuit boards.\n“If you rush in, ready to impale yourself on that nasty sword of his,” Rocket said, “Knull won’t even notice you’re wearin’ a portable version of that tech. As he revels in his victory, Venom will sneak in and slip one onto him, too. Then, once you’re reborn in the White Hot Room, I can activate the sequence and — switcheroo! Knull gets annihilated by the light while you’re returned back to us, safe and sound. In theory, at least... I can’t guarantee the tech will work across dimensional planes. But everythin’ else we’ve tried has already failed. This might be our last chance…”\n“Then it’s one we have to take…” Jean agreed, grabbing Rocket’s circuit board and running towards the last place they had seen the King in Black. “I came here to stop Knull, and I plan to see it through… no matter the cost.” \n“Whoa! Hold on a minute, Red!” Rocket said, a bit of panic in his voice. “I gotta calibrate a few things first if we actually wanna pull this off! Gimme, like, five minutes and then you can go right back to gettin’ yourself skewered. Promise.”\nAs Phoenix and Venom huddled together to discuss the details of Rocket’s elaborate plan, Rocket found a secluded spot near the entrance of a cave. He sat down and removed some tools from the pouches on his belt, then began to tinker with the second Nega-Energy Replicator board. It was delicate work that required absolute focus, so Rocket didn’t even notice when the ground beneath him started to shift. \n“Rocket!” a voice yelled from nearby. “Look out!” \n“Huh?” Rocket said, looking up from his work to see the Scarlet Witch flying towards him at top speed. It looked like she was about to attack him, but that didn’t make any sense. They were on the same side… weren’t they? Rocket instinctively reached for his blaster cannon, but as he did, he felt a sharp pain course through his body. By the time he realized what had just happened, it was too late. He was already trapped in the jaws of a giant symbiote dragon! \n“You’ve gotta be kiddin’ me!” Rocket groaned as he tried with all of his might to struggle free from the dragon’s mouth. But with every movement, the creature’s teeth sunk deeper into Rocket’s flesh. Rocket tossed the Nega-Energy Replicator a safe distance away and then reached down and grabbed a quantum grenade from his belt, ready to detonate it if needed. He knew full well that the blast would obliterate him as well, but if it stopped this monster from messing up his master plan, it would ultimately be worth it.  \n“If I’m gonna be your last meal,” he yelled, “I sure as flark ain’t gonna go down easy!” \n“You won’t be anyone’s meal today,” Scarlet Witch said as she released a wave of chaos magic from her hands that surrounded the symbiote dragon. “To be fair, you’re barely an appetizer.”\nRocket let out a painful laugh as the dragon’s jaws began to loosen their grip on him. It was enough for him to be able to push free… right in time to watch the Scarlet Witch’s spell break the enormous beast down into a puddle of undulating goop.\n“That’ll teach ya to mess with a Guardian of the Galaxy!” Rocket shouted at the puddle, firing at the writhing sludge with his blaster cannon.  \n“I think we beat him,” Scarlet Witch said reassuringly as she stood next to Rocket, “but I fear it may have been a bit too late.” \n“What are ya talkin’ about?” Rocket asked, putting on a brave face as he tried to dismiss the severity of his wounds. “I’m perfectly… fine…” \nBut Rocket knew otherwise the second he saw the sparks shooting out from several of the puncture wounds that had been left behind by the dragon’s fangs. There was no hiding the fact that Rocket's cybernetic implants had been severely damaged. These devices were so deeply integrated into Rocket's biological systems that he would barely be able to function if they were compromised. And to make matters worse, they were so highly sophisticated that only Rocket's original modifier — or someone with intimate knowledge of his body — would be able to build and install replacements.\n“You gotta find Groot for me…” Rocket said to the Scarlet Witch as he fell to his knees. “Tell him I’m sorry… That I didn’t wanna go out this way… And that he doesn’t need me to watch his back anymore…” \nThe Scarlet Witch immediately began to cast a healing spell to protect Rocket, but the furry fighter knew it would take more than magic to save him now. It would take a miracle. And Klyntar wasn’t exactly the kind of planet where people’s prayers tended to be answered. So what happened next took Rocket by complete surprise. \nAnother symbiote slithered its way over to the wounded Rocket. Unlike the dragon that had unleashed its vicious surprise attack earlier, this symbiote moved slowly and cautiously, putting itself in clear sight so that Rocket was aware of its arrival. And for some reason, Rocket felt no reason to be afraid of this creature. In fact, its presence felt almost comforting. And Rocket realized why as soon as the symbiote touched his fur-covered hand.\nEarlier, when the Guardians of the Galaxy first returned to Klyntar, they were attacked by a horde of symbiotes that forcefully bonded with them, momentarily causing the heroes to fall under the thrall of Knull. Thanks to the indomitable spirit of Jeff the Land Shark, the symbiotes were broken free from their hivemind, restoring the Guardians’ free will. Although the encounter had ended quickly, the bond that Rocket had formed with his symbiotic partner must have lasted… because here it was again in his time of need… \nAs the symbiote enveloped Rocket’s entire body, he could feel it seeping into his wounds, as if thoroughly examining every damaged component inside of him. Then, without warning, the symbiote removed itself from Rocket and reshaped its protoplasmic form, creating slimy tendrils that each ended in what looked like specialized tools. \nRocket could only watch in confusion as the symbiote began to repurpose parts from his own blaster to craft temporary replacements for his implants. With surgical precision, the symbiote installed the components into Rocket's body. As soon as they began to power up, Rocket could tell that he was going to be okay. He couldn’t fully understand how, but this symbiote knew exactly what to do to save his life. And he wasn’t about to waste his second chance.\nPushing himself back onto his feet, Rocket found the Nega-Energy Replicator he had been working on earlier. He made a few finishing touches and rushed off to find Jean Grey and Venom. Soon the battle with Knull would finally be over… and when it was, Rocket had plenty of questions that needed to be answered… \nLATER.\n“…and then the little guy put me back together again, good as new,” Rocket said, recounting the tale of his unusual experience on Klyntar.  \n“Not quite as good as new…” said Reed Richards as he examined Rocket under the scanners in his lab at the Baxter Building, “…but certainly good enough. I should be able to handle the rest from here. Still, for a symbiote, it did a shockingly thorough job of repairing your internal systems. The question is… how?”\n“I was wonderin’ the same thing, Doc,” Rocket said. “I’m guessin’ that, when I first bonded with the thing, it got full access to my memories… includin’ ones I didn’t even realize I had. Like ones from way back when I first got my implants.” \n“That might make sense,” Reed said, “but only if you had engineered and installed the components yourself. Logically, it might have known the locations of your implants from the frequent injuries you’ve suffered over the years, or even from body scans you may have seen. But it’s highly unlikely it would have known how to fabricate functioning replacements. Unless…” \n“Unless what?” Rocket asked as Reed trailed off into deep thought. “Don’t leave me hangin’ here!” \n“Unless,” Reed continued, “the symbiote had previously bonded with someone who not only understood the enhancement process you underwent, but who also knew you personally and intimately. Someone from your world, perhaps…”\n“Not many folks left out there who fit that bill,” Rocket mused. “And I ain’t got a clue where my little symbiote savior slithered off to after he fixed me up, so I guess we’ve got no way of figurin’ it out.” \n“Actually, we do,” Reed replied. “From studying Peter’s old suit, which I suppose is the Venom symbiote now, over the years, I’ve learned that when a symbiote bonds with a host, it leaves behind a trace of itself in the host’s body called a codex. This genetic imprint not only identifies the symbiote itself, but also every other host it has ever bonded with. It’s more than just a fingerprint. It’s a family tree, if you will.” \n“Well, then I gotta know who else has been climbin’ around in those branches!” Rocket said.\n“Let me see,” Reed said, grabbing another device and running it along the length of Rocket’s spine. “Hmmm… that’s curious… According to my scans, there are traces of all sorts of alien DNA in the codex. That’s to be expected, I suppose. But there’s also something that is a near-perfect match for a species found here on Earth.” \n“Really?” Rocket inquired. “Back on Halfworld, they experimented on all sorts of animals. I may be the very best of the lot, but it’s possible someone else got off that miserable planet and made their way to Klyntar. The question is, who?”\n“All I can say for sure is that they had the characteristics surprisingly similar to the genetic subfamily Lutrinae,” Reed replied. \n“That don’t ring any bells,” Rocket said, scratching his furry head. \n“Here on Earth, we more commonly call them otters,” Reed added. \nRocket’s eyes went wide. There was only one otter he knew back on Halfworld, and she knew him more intimately than anyone else in the galaxy, including Groot. \n“Lylla…” Rocket whispered under his breath in astonishment. \nHe couldn’t believe his old friend was still out there somewhere. But the fact that they had both bonded with the same symbiote couldn’t be just a coincidence. And it wasn’t a miracle either. It was a sign. A sign that he had to find her. Rocket had no way of knowing where Lyla was now, but he was willing to scour the entire galaxy to find out. It was another plan he had to see through… no matter the cost.",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10240010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "From the throne atop her realm, the Queen of Hel recalled feeling the shattering of worlds, the sundering of realities as unknown forces knit them together again. Differently. She remembered venturing forth into her kingdom, only to discover that in Hel little had changed. However, Hela suspected once she traveled beyond her realm, she would see profound changes—and when she had worked enchantments to gaze upon worlds newly interwoven with the Ten Realms, her suspicions were confirmed. Mortals had done this? Remade time itself? Broken it and rewound different streams into a different braid or worlds? \nWhat power was this for men to wield? \nImmediately, Hela set about scheming a way to make it hers.\nFirst, she knew, she must understand Chronovium. One of her thralls, in life a great wizard-king, had brought to her a stone of a sort she had never seen before in Hel. She had paid it little mind until she grasped what the mortal Victor von Doom had done. Then, she sent the flock. Her crows scouted other realms, all returning bearing samples of Chronovium, the crystallized residue of the monstrous shocks to the space-time continuum. And yet, they all differed slightly from the version in Hel and from one another.\nWhoever learned best to control it, Hela knew, would rule worlds beyond Asgard. Beyond the Ten Realms. \nHela's intrigue deepened. New lands meant expanding the borders of Hel and welcoming vast numbers of new creatures into her ever-growing legions, perhaps even claiming the souls of the great beings known as Celestials. Only recently had she become aware of them, and then only through a new soul in Hel, cast there from another universe by the — what had he called it? — the Timestream Entanglement. This pitiful mortal, who met their end in the event, spilled forth knowledge of vast realms of space filled with fantastic creatures. \nAt a wave of her hand, Hela's crows feasted on the mortal's soul, her mind settling on a goal. The souls, and thus the power, of these great beings would belong to her. And when they did, she would sweep unchallenged through the Ten Realms, uniting them under the banner of Hel. Undoubtedly, Loki was hatching his own schemes to utilize Chronovium to increase his own power and ensure Asgard never slipped from his grasp, but Loki's schemes never worried Hela. Often, his petty obsessions and caprices benefited her by causing conflicts that added to her legions. At some point, she suspected, he would approach her proposing some sort of arrangement. Perhaps an alliance. Perhaps she would consent, and they would begin the dance of waiting for the right moment to betray each other. The joys of family.\nUntil then, she would proceed with her own plans, which led her to the current moment, as a messenger from a distant place she had never heard of before. Her initial response was to annihilate it for the arrogant crime of trespassing in her realm. However, it seemed to her that these disruptions of time and space could be a gift. Had it not opened vast new possibilities for Hel? Surely, she should learn what new worlds — new universes! — now lay within her grasp. \nSo, her crows stood perched while the otherworldly emissary trudged into her throne room.\nIt was a strange creature, appearing like blobs and tendrils of a tarry black substance bonded with a host. Its liquid flesh mingled aspects of its own nature and that of its host — currently a Jotun priestess. Even though she was no longer alive, enough of the Jotun's soul was still present for Hela to feel her horror at being bound to such a monstrosity. How curious.\nThe creature, however — the symbiote — had no such misgivings, or at least did not betray them. \n\"Tell me, little creature. What brings you to this place?\"\n\"You would do well to listen, Queen of Death,\" it said. \"I bring tidings from Knull, mighty lord of the abyss.\"\n\"And what is a 'Knull'? Is he the god of all creatures such as you?\" She made no effort to hide her scorn. This Knull was, in all likelihood, as debased and parasitic as its worshipper who stood before her.\n\"His power is eons older than yours, ancient before light existed, and he has his own claims on creatures whose essences he has consumed.\"\nAh, Hela thought. Of course. \"I take it he means to claim the Celestials as well?\"\nThe symbiote nodded and flicked out its tongue. \"Knull has learned that one of the Celestials is now in this realm. You cannot keep it, Asgardian. It is his to claim and it will be the key to his freedom.\"\n\"I cannot?\" Hela stood from her throne. \"Bold of you, parasite, to tell me what I can and cannot do in my own realm. What enters Hel is mine, forever. In fact,\" she said, giving the symbiote a closer look, \"perhaps I will even keep you. What manner of soul does a creature like you possess?\"\nThe symbiote remained still. Hela let it wonder for quite a while, as she pondered what she had already learned. The key to his freedom, the emissary had said. So, this Knull was a god in chains, yet he still possessed the reach to send a message to Hel. He knew the power of Celestials. He knew that the tangled worlds had brought new souls into Hel. \nTherefore, there must now be a way from Hel to… \"What is the world you come from, creature?\"\n\"Klyntar, O Queen.\"\nA name she knew vaguely. People from a culture long since annihilated had once come to her realm from there. She considered a little longer. \n\"I release you,\" she said. \"Now, release your host.\"\nThe symbiote did, peeling and secreting and withdrawing from the skeletal form of the Jotun priestess. \"Return to your master,\" Hela went on, \"and tell him that he may rule Klyntar, but Hela rules Hel. And if he wishes to fight me…\" she smiled. \"Then he too will become one of my subjects. Do you have that, messenger?\"\nThe symbiote mass quivered, but without a host it could not speak. Hela worked a spell, drawing forth knowledge from its mind. She swirled open a gateway to a world of darkness, an impenetrable jungle where no sane mortal would tread. \"Go,\" Hela said, \"before I change my mind.\"\nThe symbiote sprang through the gateway and was gone. Hela let the gateway close. Now, Knull knew that she could reach out to his world directly. Let him think on that and consider his next move. \nHela gathered up a mass of Chronovium, imbued with the essence of Hel. Just as all lives must end, she reflected, all things must move through time. Did it not follow that all time ended in Hel as well? And did it not follow that Hel could grow through this crystallized time, encompassing new realms brought near by the entanglement of worlds? \nThe Hel-Chronovium was shot through with black and green. She spoke to it, shaping it into an enchantment, the first of many. \"All living beings,\" she said, \"in all realms, in all universes. They shall be thralls of Hel. They need not come to me. I will use you, Chronovium, to expand Hel not through space but through time. Beings more ancient than stars will be mine, and beings not yet born will be mine. This is a powerful magic and will take some time to work. But it shall be done, and then Knull?\" She smiled. \"He will be mine as well.\"\nShe suspected that the symbiote emissary was not Knull's only gambit. Doubtless he was plotting against her, seeking ways to undermine her and the reach of Hel. Let him, she thought. Let him beguile mortals and persuade greedy gods that they can band together against me. That would bring them all the closer — and as she had already told the symbiote emissary, whatever entered Hel was Hela's. Unless she chose to let it go.\nAnd soon, souls would no longer come to Hel, Hel would come to them. Her realm would grow outward through time, drawing in numberless souls until she had an army so vast not even gods could hope to resist it. The Ten Realms were just the beginning.\nShe spun the black and green Chronovium jewel over her palm. \"Yield to me your secrets,\" she commanded. \"Bring to me the future, as I already rule the past.\"",

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10240_Story_#1_Content": "In the countless centuries that I have lived, I have never seen much use for kings. They are a loud, boorish lot whose deeds never seem to match their words.\nTake Odin, for instance. The so-called All-Father claimed to be the most powerful ruler in the Ten Realms, and yet he couldn’t even save his own kingdom without having to take a multi-year nap immediately after. In all my time as the Queen of Hel, I have never once had so much as a single day off. I suppose the old saying is right. “No rest for the wicked.”\nI thought, perhaps, my opinion of kings might change for the better when Loki took over the throne of Yggsgard. His goals were certainly more aligned with my own, after all, and he promised to help me expand my domain of the dead into the mortal realm in exchange for my aid. But it wasn’t long before that frost-born fool got distracted from his own nefarious scheme and started to look for other ways to spread mischief. And so, instead of draining the World Tree of its Chronovium-infused sap, as he had sworn to do, he flitted off to Midgard, where he joined a band of warriors in combat against vampiric legions and killer robots. Perhaps it was in order to keep those threats from spreading into Yggsgard. Or, more likely, it was in hopes of making the mortals his playthings again. Either way, it was all so predictable, as Loki always was.\nWhile I admit I did join the fray myself for a time, I had my reasons as well. If one of those self-proclaimed “super heroes” happened to perish on the field of battle, I believed I would be able to swoop in and claim their powerful soul as a trophy. It was all part of my master plan. If I could make one of them my new champion, I wouldn’t need Loki any longer. I would be able to conquer Yggsgard and all of the other realms of the living myself. Yet somehow, every time they fell, those accursed mortals found a way to get back up again. And I began to lose my patience.\nAfter a particularly irritating clash on a Midgard-adjacent planet called Arakko, I had finally had enough. I took my leave, fully intent on returning to my castle in Niffleheim to formulate a new scheme… but then the most peculiar thing happened. I heard someone whispering my name. The voice was sweet and sinister at the same time, like a lullaby spilling from the lips of a fresh corpse. Not only was it absolutely enchanting… it was strangely familiar as well… \nIt took me a moment before I could place where I had heard the voice before, but I soon realized that it was when I had briefly joined forces with the mortals on Klyntar. That world was populated by a race of ravenous parasitic creatures — the very same species that had dared to send an emissary to Hel as a harbinger of their dark lord’s impending return. As we traveled under the planet’s surface, I had sworn that someone was calling out to me. Could it be the same King in Black that the symbiote messenger had spoken of earlier? I hoped so, for I wished to have words with this Knull for threatening me in my own domain… but sadly, our time on Klyntar ended more quickly (and explosively) than expected, and the voice was silenced before I could ever identify its true source.\nNow it had returned, though, and whoever it belonged to was seeking an audience with me. Using a shard of the Bifrost that I had stolen from Odin’s Vault during my stay on Yggsgard, I opened a portal across the cosmos and soon found myself standing on Klyntar’s undulating surface once again. I was not thrilled to have my boots sullied by the grotesque creatures that populated this world, but my curiosity outweighed my disgust.\nFollowing the voice, I navigated my way into a series of caverns that led deeper and deeper beneath Klyntar’s surface. I was no stranger to underworlds, but even I took pause as all traces of light began to fade from view. For once I felt as though I might actually be out of my depth. But then, my black soul trembled as I heard the mysterious voice directly in front of me, so close I felt as if I could reach out and touch it. And for some reason that I could not quite explain, I wanted to… so very desperately…\n“Sweet Hela…” it said. “Home at last…”\n“Show yourself,” I commanded.\n“You do not give the orders on this world, woman,” the voice replied.\n“Really?” I mused. “Then, pray tell, who does?”\n“I do,” the voice responded.\n“And you are?” I asked, already knowing the answer full well.\n“Knull,” the voice said proudly. “God of Darkness. The King in Black.”\n“I have heard of you,” I muttered. “But I have no need for another king.”\n“You do not need anyone,” Knull said. “That is exactly why I chose you.”\n“Do go on…” I said, enjoying Knull’s flattery.\n“When I first sent my progeny to your realm,” Knull said, “it was with a warning. You dared to defy me, but you did not raise my ire. Instead, you intrigued me. Then, when you came to my world, it was clear that my curiosity about you was justified. You did not belong with those who opposed me. I could sense something different inside of you — a darkness not unlike my own. I believe we may be kindred spirits.”\n“If you are attempting to court me,” I replied flippantly, “then I expect you to at least be brave enough to show me your face.”\n“If only I could…” Knull said, feigning despair. It was obvious he was playing a game, but he was quite good at it. Almost as good as me. “Alas, my children trapped me deep within the heart of their own home world eons ago. I am a prisoner of my own creations… at least until someone finally sets me free…”\n“Ah…” I responded, “…so you would have me be your pawn then. How typical.”\n“Not my pawn,” Knull responded, pretending to be wounded by my words. “My queen.”\n“I am already a queen,” I said. “I have a realm to call my own and millions of souls in my army, all ready to obey my every command. What could you possibly offer me that I do not already have?”\n“The rest of them,” Knull said. “Every mortal soul that ever lived. When I am finally free from my bonds, I will snuff out the stars. And then, every last creature that was ever born into this ill-begotten universe will become yours for all of eternity.”\n“And why would you give me such an extravagant present, my dear?” I asked. “You barely know me.” \n“I disagree,” Knull replied. “I know you all too well. Like me, you were created for a purpose. We help maintain a universal balance, you and I. It is no easy task — one you most certainly did not choose, but one you have proudly dedicated your very existence to nonetheless. And yet, those shortsighted fools who fight in the name of life and light fail to recognize our glorious purpose. They consider us evil, when what we actually are is necessary. They have tried to conquer us, and they have always failed. Why? Because the universe cannot exist without us. Life and death, light and dark. Those forces cannot be separated. And while one can be pushed down for a time, it eventually returns, stronger than ever.”\n“Hmm…” I said, pondering Knull’s words. “…it seems you do know me. Almost as well as I know myself. What is it you would have me do for you?”\n“Reign,” he responded. “Sit on my throne and rule this world. Protect it from the onslaught to come. From the righteous fires that would scorch it to ash, and the prodigal sons that would return to strike their creator down. Reign with the same ruthlessness you always have, milady, and that will be more than enough.”\n“And when you return, my lord?” I asked. “What then?”\n“Then we shall look out over the endless abyss we have created with pride,” Knull said, his voice growing stronger. “We shall live out the rest of eternity in the darkness of the void together. And should the forces of light and life dare try to rise against us ever again, which they inevitably will, we will revel as we crush them beneath our boots.”\n“You truly know the way to a girl’s heart,” I responded, a smile twisting across my lips. “I accept.”\n“Then come to me, my queen…” Knull beckoned.\nSuddenly, the darkness of the subterranean cavern was replaced by the crimson glow of a strange spiral pattern on the cavern wall. The red symbol pulsed, as if it was alive. I placed my hand on it and tried to use my arcane powers to syphon its energy, but to no avail. Instead, the wall itself began to open, as if the spiral was a lock and my hand the key. I stepped into the vast cavern that had revealed itself, and far in the distance I saw what I had been seeking. There stood a pillar made from the same material as Klyntar itself… and at its top, a majestic figure sat, waiting. \nNot willing to delay reaching my destination any longer, I transformed myself into a Nastrond crow and flew to meet Knull face-to-face at last. When I arrived, I resumed my godly form and approached the King in Black. With a sinister smile, he silently reached out his hand to me, touching my forehead with a single finger as white as bone. I could feel his sigil burning itself into my flesh, the very same blood red spiral that had appeared on the wall moments ago.\nImmediately, the organic material from which the pillar was made extended towards me, surrounding my body. I struggled against it at first, not fully realizing what was happening, but then Knull spoke again.\n“Do not resist, my love,” he said. “This is my gift to you. The first of many…”\nOnce the symbiotic substance had completely enveloped my form, I realized that Knull had been telling the truth. This was a gift indeed, one that made me feel more powerful than ever. And now I could hear his voice even louder, as if he was sharing my own mind with me. \n“Rise, my Queen in Black,” he said. “Rise so that all others may fall!”\nAnd rise I did. I turned and walked triumphantly from the cavern, my new garments rippling around me as they guided me back to the outside world with ease. It felt as if I knew every inch of Klyntar as well as I knew my own realm. Certainly these vestments would provide a great advantage in the battle to come, I thought. But it wasn’t until I reached the surface that I realized how soon that battle would begin.\nThere, off in the night sky, I could see a star growing brighter. No… not a star… a being of some sort, racing ever closer toward the planet. As it continued its approach, its shape became clear. It was a giant bird with flaming wings. Could this be the same fire-haired Phoenix that Odin used to sing love songs about after too many tankards of ale? I supposed I would find out soon enough. Until then, I would sit on Knull’s throne, claiming it as my own, and waiting patiently for the light to arrive so that I could extinguish it… in the name of my king…",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10260010_HeroGalleryInfo_Story_#0_Content": "While he gazed out over the landscape of the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda’s throneworld, King T’Challa paused for a moment to marvel at what his people had built. His mother had always dreamed of reaching the stars, but T’Challa and his sister Shuri — along with countless brilliant Wakandan scientists and engineers — had finally made that dream a reality. \n\nAs Wakanda’s influence spread across the galaxy, bringing more people and planets under their banner and their protection, the Wakandan ideal — progress and tradition intertwined, science and magic woven together — remained the pillar of the empire. T’Challa did his best to embody both sides of the nation’s complex heritage. But on occasion, he found the two at odds.\n\nToday, T’Challa stood in the Hall of Djalia, listening for ancient voices that would not speak to him. The Orisha — the pantheon of gods worshipped by the people of Wakanda — had fallen unusually silent, causing great concern. Even Bast — the goddess who had chosen T’Challa as her avatar, the Black Panther — seemed to be absent from this sacred place. Perhaps, T’Challa thought, they simply had nothing to say. But the King of Wakanda found that hard to believe. \n\nAfter all, Wakanda was at war. Another king, Victor von Doom of Latveria, had tampered with the fabric of space and time, unleashing a chronal cascade across countless dimensions. Even T’Challa’s empire, which had been a safe haven for so many for so long, wasn’t immune to its effects. And now he had learned that there were two Dooms from two different timelines vying for control. Both had tried to enlist T’Challa in their battles, suggesting that Wakanda and Latveria were more alike than different. T’Challa respectfully disagreed. \n\nThe King of Wakanda knew better than to trust either Doom. But he also knew the time would come where he would have to choose a side, not only to protect his empire, but all of existence as well. Wakanda could not remain neutral for much longer when so much was at stake. \n\nT’Challa had so many questions, all of which the gods and goddesses of the Orisha refused to answer. All of them… save for one… \n\nNot long ago, while praying to Bast for guidance and wisdom, T’Challa’s humble pleas were instead answered by a goddess long-banished from Wakanda: Bast’s sister, K'Liluna, the Betrayer. Her quest for vengeance against her sister had led to K’Liluna’s ruin centuries ago and her name had rarely been uttered by the people of Wakanda since. But now, she had chosen to come forth and speak with T’Challa in Bast’s absence, warning him of a darkness to come… a darkness that she claimed had already tainted the Orisha.\n\nT’Challa didn’t know what to believe. Certainly not the words of one as treacherous as K'Liluna. He dared not risk allying himself with Bast’s deceitful sister, in fear that the Orisha might rain their judgement down upon the entire empire for his disloyalty. But yet, something in the Betrayer’s words rang true. The Orisha’s silence had given T’Challa cause for concern… and now K’Liluna had sowed the seeds of doubt. It was taking all of T’Challa’s willpower not to let those seeds grow wild…\n\nBut the reason for the Orisha’s absence would have to remain a mystery for a while longer. The King of Wakanda had other more urgent matters to attend to. He had been summoned by his sister, Shuri, to discuss some recent developments regarding the restoration of the timestream. One crisis at a time, thought T’Challa, as he took a deep breath and entered the lab… \n\n“Welcome, brother,” Shuri said as T’Challa stepped into the room. All of the scientists inside, Shuri included, crossed their arms in an X across their chests as a salute to their monarch. \n\n“Sister,” T’Challa responded with a smile and a salute of his own. The two had not agreed on much these past weeks since the timestream began to disintegrate, but he still had a deep love for his sister and an even deeper respect for her work. \n\n“Were you off brooding in the Hall of Djalia again?” Shuri asked. \n\n“Not brooding,” T’Challa said. “Waiting for guidance.” \n\n“Your people are waiting for you to guide them,” Shuri responded. “And I think I can help. I’ve been gathering data about the Timestream Entanglement…”\n\n“Data does not always tell the whole story, sister…” T’Challa said. As he spoke, he was fully aware of the irony of his statement. He was currently withholding critical data about K’Liluna and her claims that the Orisha had fallen into some dark corruption. Yet he decided to keep that information under wraps for the time being, at least until he knew for sure. He did not wish to distract his sister from her efforts, nor to bring the fury of Bast down upon him. \n\n“This data tells us enough,” Shuri continued, fully aware that her older brother was holding something back. But she didn’t have time to coax secrets out of him. There was science to be done! \n\n“I have been consulting with Reed Richards and Tony Stark from the other Chronoverse on their plans for a Timestream Reintegration Device,” Shuri continued, “and I think we are close to a breakthrough.”\n\n“With your brilliant mind at their disposal, I would expect no less,” T’Challa responded proudly, placing a hand gently upon his sister’s shoulder. But he could sense an unusual tension in her body. He knew she was about to ask him for something… and that it was something she already knew her brother would not like…  \n\n“Reed and Tony have a theory…” Shuri began slowly, each word carefully calculated, “…a theory that I believe has some merit…” \n\n“Say what you need, sister,” T’Challa urged. \n\n“Chronovium,” Shuri said quietly, knowing her brother might disapprove. “More specifically, Chrono-Vibranium.” \n\nChronovium was a crystal that had begun to manifest after the Timestream Entanglement rippled across realities. According to the research of Wakanda’s scientists, unique variations of Chronovium seemed to be forming in locations of great power. In Wakanda, the crystals were infused with more than just chronal energy. They also contained power drawn directly from the Vibranium Star at the heart of the empire. \n\n“Richards and Stark have their own supplies,” T’Challa said dismissively. “Those will have to suffice.” \n\n“I am telling you now, brother, they will not,” Shuri responded pointedly, beginning to lose her patience. The fate of multiple universes hinged on her collaboration with Earth’s heroes. This was no time for her big brother to be his usual stubborn self. \n\n“This is not just an excuse for Stark to get his hands on Wakanda’s toys,” Shuri continued. “I have run the numbers independently. The TRD can restore our dimension to its proper state, but it needs a power source greater than what standard Chronovium can supply.”\n\n“The answer is no,” T’Challa said firmly\n\n“Then the question is why?” Shuri said, pushing back. Whatever T’Challa was hiding from her, she wasn’t about to let it bring about the end of all that is. If there was a way to get through to her brother, as there always had been in the past, she had to find it. \n\n“I… cannot say…” T’Challa replied, “Not for certain, at least. But I have reason to believe that there is a greater darkness awaiting us, Shuri… Something even the gods themselves may not be able to protect our people from…”\n\n“Then let us protect them together,” Shuri said.\n\n“For now, this is a matter I must face alone,” T’Challa replied. \n\n“How many times must I remind you, brother?” Shuri asked. “You are never alone. And neither are we. Wakanda is no longer an isolationist nation. We are a galactic force! If we wish for this empire to stand, we must begin to act as such and lead by example. That starts by sharing our resources with those in need.” \n\n“We still know too little about the power of Chrono-Vibranium,” T’Challa said, softening slightly. “We cannot risk it falling into other hands, even trusted ones, until we do.” \n\n“But…” Shuri interjected. \n\n“But…” T’Challa continued, “…you have my permission to further your research on these crystals in hopes that we can safely unlock their secrets in order to pass them along.”\n\n“And until then…?” Shuri asked. \n\n“Until then, I offer our allies unlimited access to Wakanda’s greatest resource,” T’Challa said. “You.” \n\nShuri wanted to scream in frustration at her brother, but instead she bit her tongue and took the compliment. After all, coming from T’Challa, those were almost as rare as heart-shaped herbs. \n\nAs T’Challa left the lab, Shuri let out a sigh of frustration, knowing how much work she had ahead of her. But the king himself breathed a sigh of relief, knowing the fate of the empire was in good hands. At least for the moment. \n\nWith Shuri busy researching chronal crystals and engineering universal solutions, T’Challa could turn his full attention to the larger threat looming on the horizon. Even the pair of dueling Dooms would have to wait until he could identify and locate the great source of darkness of which he had been warned. \n\nBut how? T’Challa dared not reach out to K’Liluna for answers. Totems of Bast were everywhere in the empire. Even if she was not eager to answer his prayers, the panther goddess was surely listening to his every word. And she would not take kindly to his betrayal. Wakanda needed the Black Panther now more than ever, so T’Challa could not risk being stripped of his mantle or the power that came with it. \n\nThe king walked with purpose across the center of his city, Birnin T’Challa, back toward the Hall of Djalia. As he passed by, he paused at a panther statue, placing his hand gently upon its head. \n\n“Where are you, Bast?” T’Challa said out loud as he gazed into the eyes of the Vibranium sculpture. \n\n“I am here…” a voice replied. The statue began to glow with the purple energy of Djalia, the Wakandan spirit plane. T’Challa instantly knew that it was Bast speaking to him, but there was a tone in her voice he had never heard before. Something sinister. “I have been waiting for you, my champion… in the shadows…” \n\n“I am at your service,” T’Challa said, knowing deep within that his words were not fully true. Yet he knew that he must continue to feign devotion to the tainted goddess until he discovered the truth about her current state. \n\n“And you have served me well,” Bast replied, her words dripping with darkness, “but you are not the only King in Black that I have come to favor…”\n\nAs Bast spoke, the sky began to grow dim. Instinctively, T’Challa looked up toward the Hall of Djalia to see tendrils of ebony energy ensnaring its sacred spire. He didn’t know if this was yet another side effect of the Timestream Entanglement or if it was the first signs of the dark presence that of which K’Liluna alluded. But T’Challa knew he had no time to waste either way. The fate of the empire depended upon his immediate action. \n\nThe Black Panther sprung forward, racing into the Hall of Djalia. T’Challa did not know what awaited him within, but he did not fear it. Not even the gods themselves could prevent him from protecting his people in their time of need. \n\nEven in the face of the greatest threats the universe had ever known, there was only one thing to which T’Challa would pledge his loyalty. \n\nNot Doom. \n\nNot even Bast.  \n\nJust Wakanda. \n\nForever.",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10270010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "When the Milano crashed, Groot stood around for awhile watching Rocket and Quill argue about whose fault it was, but soon after, he got distracted by the voices from the jungle surrounding the ship graveyard. The strange creeping tones broke through alien foliage, flooding past the caps and reaching him, but Groot was far enough away that he couldn’t decipher their language. Eventually, Rocket and Quill got on his nerves enough that he had to get away from them, so he went for a walk. As he walked away, he heard Rocket say, “See? Even Groot can’t take your crap, Quill. I’m gonna go find a way out of here while you sit here and pretend you know how to fix the ship!” He heard Rocket stomping away in another direction, but Groot didn’t try to meet up with him. Rocket needed time by himself sometimes, and so did Groot. Especially on strange planets that stank of death.\nThe ship had come down near one end of the graveyard containing… hundreds of other ships? Maybe more? Groot wasn’t good at counting. He wandered away from the fire that burned in the Milano’s crash path, finding himself at the edge of the jungle. The voices of the jungle spoke to him, and Groot stopped and stood still, trying hard to listen now that he was close enough to understand what they were saying.\nAway get away we’ll hurt you if you get close\nA chill ran down Groot’s branches, straight into his roots. He had never heard plants talk like this. He stayed still, letting his consciousness drift out and collect impressions like a pollinator floating from flower to flower. \nHurt you hunger survival death prison Klyntar\nHey, Groot thought to them. You don’t have to be afraid.\nYou don’t belong here\n“I am Groot,” Groot said. He looked at the edge of the jungle, where it tumbled over the hulks of wrecked ships, grew among them and over them, strove to reclaim them and make it as if they were never there. These were not plants like he had ever encountered. They were part plant and part…something else. Something from Klyntar, made of Klyntar. Beings of some kind, that could only exist when they bonded to something else, creating a new being that was part host and part parasite. Groot was horrified and fascinated. \nI’m new here, Groot thought. \nGo away go back where you came from \nIt’s all right, Groot emanated peace and kindness. I am Groot.\nNone of them had names. They conferred among themselves, snapped at each other, screamed and wailed and whispered in pheromonal registers only they and Groot could understand. They were still afraid. Even more, they were confused by how friendly Groot was. He could feel that in their responses. It was like nobody had ever been friendly to them before. \nThis planet must be a hard place to live, Groot communed.\nThat idea confused them too, because it had never occurred to any of them that it was possible to live somewhere else, and they had never considered this place a “planet”.\nOh yes, friends, Groot expressed. I’ve been to dozens of other worlds. This one is… He struggled to find a thought that was honest without being hurtful. Tough, he thought. Not too friendly.\nWhat is friendly?\nWow, Groot thought. So that’s what he was dealing with. \nHe tried to project a feeling of openness. Trust, feeling understood, and knowing you were never alone, surrounded by the people important to you.\nThe jungle plants were still confused…but now they were also curious. Weakness was whispered back to Groot.\nNo, Groot said. Trust takes strength.\nThey considered this. He could feel their conflicting reactions, and Groot could not help but be astonished that none of the jungle plants had ever considered what was trust. It was so fundamental to his relationship with Rocket, and Quill, and the other Guardians…\nHeat seared his branches as a huge explosion bloomed over the junkyard. Groot flinched away from it, stepping into the jungle, and turned to look from the relative safety of the tangled vines and underbrush.\nThe fire caused by the Milano’s crash had spread, and finally found another ship with a reserve of fuel or ammunition. The mushroom cloud of the explosion still spread over Klyntar’s black sky, and the fire was now racing across the graveyard. Towards the jungle.\nPanic and fear spread among the plants. Groot felt fear too, partly for them and partly for himself. Fire was any plant’s worst enemy, worse even than drought. At least in a drought, you could hope for rain. \nAlso, Groot could move. These plants…they might be part symbiote, but by and large they were still rooted to their spots. \nThat meant Groot had to help them. \nHe saw the fire approaching, licking along the lines of the crashed ship toward the edges of the graveyard, where the jungle had begun to reclaim the wrecks. Already some plants were forced out of their innate shape – black, slimy liquid dripping between their leaves, but their new symbiote form could not help them confront nor escape their natural enemy. Flowers screamed their pain, but there was no host for them with which to bond, no shelter for them to hide — so Groot got angry. \nIn his anger he grew. Thousands of feet of roots dug into Klyntar’s soil, spreading along the boundary of the jungle. Groot forced them out, felt them searching for nourishment and finding little, but still he grew them, until he had created an intertwined mat of roots under the soil, overlapping the edge of the jungle and the outermost crashed spaceships.\nThen, he closed his eyes and lifted them up. The earth heaved under those ships, toppling them over away from the jungle with a gargantuan sound of tearing roots and shifting earth. The pain of tearing the plant life from himself was nothing compared to the satisfaction Groot felt when the wall of roots and wrecked spaceships collapsed on the fire, suffocating it immediately where it had been threatening the jungle. Even those few embers that remained would have had to cross a firebreak fifty yards across to reach the jungle. \nGroot let the roots die off into the earth. He stood silently for a moment, recovering his strength as the fire sputtered and crackled among the jumbled wreckage. He was happy. Even better, he heard the voices of the jungle, and he could tell that his new plant friends were grateful.\nGroot save us Groot go save other friend, one of them said.\nWhat? Which friend? Groot looked back over the ship graveyard. The area around the Milano was still unburned, so unless Quill had gone wandering, he was fine. \nThat left Rocket. \nOne of the plants —thin leaves clinging to spine-liked stem with a mouth similar to symbiotes on the end of this stem— volunteered that it had seen a smallish mammal headed in the direction of the old complex of buildings.\nGroot didn’t know where that was. The plant rustled and tensed some of its leaves. They pointed in a certain direction. When Groot looked that way, he saw two things. One, the fire had spread not just to the edge of the jungle but a complex of buildings he had somehow missed.\nRocket is in there?\nThe plant coiled in a shrugging motion. That way.\nGroot thanked the plant and charged across the ship graveyard, giving the fire a wide berth and arriving at a corner of the building complex just as one side of it was catching fire. He punched through a wall on the other side. “I am Groot!” he roared over the sound of the fire.\n“Groot, you idiot! What took you so long? You think I’m in here for my health?”\nRocket was alive! Groot charged into the building toward the sound of Rocket’s voice. Halfway there, he ran straight into a group of tentacled black monsters. They were trying to get at Rocket, who was stuck inside a room with some kind of energy barrier blocking its doorway with turrets ripped out of the walls, strewn upon the floor. \n“I AM GROOT!” he roared, tearing the monsters apart. More came from the darkened halls and rooms. Groot tore them to pieces too, but there were still more, and still more. He knew he might not make it to Rocket, but that wasn’t going to stop him from trying. Their fangs and claws stung his bark and tore at his roots. Groot roared and fought back. He heard Rocket calling his name, but he couldn’t spare the focus to answer. All he could do at that moment was stay alive as the black monsters overran him.\nThen help came from an unexpected source. Fungi-like plants sprouted from the dark. Groot witnessed the fangs on their caps pierced through the monsters, tearing them apart, and the minor plants under their cover gobbled the pieces all up. We help! The plants called to Groot. \n“I am Groot!” he shouted back, glad to see his new friends — and feeling proud that on this planet where every plant was suspicious and hostile, he had helped them learn how to be friends. \n“Who are you talking to? I’m over here!” Rocket shouted.\n“I am Groot!”\n“What do you mean, it’s hard to explain?”\nGroot didn’t try to elaborate. He fought through the remaining symbiotes to reach Rocket, who was hunkered down in a small room with an energy barrier across the door.\n“I am Groot.”\n“Yeah, I know.” Rocket turned off the energy barrier. “How did you know I was here?”\nGroot turned and pointed at the symbiote plant, which was clinging to a corner of the corridor, extending its leaves, pretending to be a casual plant. Not a successful mimicry, obviously, for it was still trying to force the mouth on its stem to smile friendly. “I am Groot.”\n“Groot, you moron! You trusted a symbiote to tell you how to help me escape from other symbiotes?”\nGroot looked at Rocket. “I am Groot.”\n“I know it worked! Still…” Rocket gave up. “Whatever. Anyway, Quill needs help way worse than I do. Come on, we gotta get back to the Milano before the symbiotes remember he’s there.” Rocket powered the energy barrier down and started detaching it from its fixtures in the doorframe. “Here, you gotta carry this. I’m gonna use it to fix the ship.” He chuckled to himself. “Quill’s gonna feel so dumb when I show him this trick. I love it.”\nGroot picked up the energy barrier projection frame and started back toward the Milano. The voices of Klyntar’s plants were still in his head. He felt proud of himself for what the symbiote plants had done, not because Groot could take credit for it, but because he had helped them see what they could do on their own, just by being friendly. \nHe'd tell Rocket about it one day, but he knew deep down that Rocket already understood the power of friendship.\n",

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10280_Story_#0_Content": "After his assault on the Hellfire Gala, Ultron returned to Arakko triumphant, with a new form and a new purpose.\nWhen he had first journeyed to Earth, it had been with a personal goal in mind: to disrupt a mysterious assailant’s attempts to remove him from the timeline.\nBut Ultron’s time on Krakoa had shown him just how small and petty the scope of his mission had become. He was letting revenge drive him instead of the one thing he had truly come to love while traversing the cosmos over the last seven decades — conquest.\nNow, with the heroes of Earth still reeling from his surprise attack, it was time for Ultron to get back to doing what he did best. \nUltron’s time on Krakoa had changed more than just his focus, however. He had emerged from the fray as an entirely new construct. At the peak of the battle, he had shed his previous robotic form — a body forged from a rare Mysterium alloy — in order to upgrade to something entirely different. Using the Mutant machine known as Cerebro, he had recalibrated the Krakoan Resurrection Protocols and generated himself an advanced techno-organic body unlike any of his prior forms. Once his memory files were successfully downloaded into this new frame, he then donned Cerebro itself, amplifying his processing power far beyond his previous capabilities. Like the Mutants who called Krakoa home, Ultron had evolved into something completely unique. He had become X-Tron. \nUpon returning to Arakko, X-Tron began to realize that his current form came with unexpected capabilities. He could feel chronal energy coursing through his circuits as freely as the electricity that powered him. He deduced that the techno-organic virus that had served as the foundation for his new body must have bonded with genetic material from the living island of Krakoa itself as it was being generated within the Cradle. And since Krakoa had absorbed an excess of chronal energy when it was ripped through the timestream, X-Tron now shared in the island’s bounty. Similarly, that same virus had likely left traces of X-Tron himself in the very soil of Krakoa. The two beings were now linked in ways that even X-Tron could not have predicted. And it was a development that the villain could almost certainly use to his advantage. \nPerhaps he could use that chronal energy to anchor himself in the timestream and prevent himself from being erased by whoever was manipulating it against him. Perhaps he could use his newfound symbiotic relationship with Krakoa to store his essential data within the island’s vast reserves of Chronovium, offering a failsafe should someone unexpectedly succeed in destroying his physical form. Or perhaps this strange energy could be used as a weapon in his ongoing quest for universal domination. \nX-Tron had already conquered countless civilizations across the galaxy. It wouldn’t be long before Earth, Arakko, and every other inhabited planet were assimilated into his machine empire. But this new power that flowed through him opened an exciting possibility. Once he had amassed total control of this reality, he theorized that he might be able to tap into the chronal energy to invade other timelines, resulting in a mechanical multiverse! And Cerebro — which had been altered by the Scarlet Witch’s sorcery to locate Mutants in other dimensions — would be X-Tron’s key to opening gateways to any point across space and time. \n“The Ages of X-Tron are about to begin,” X-Tron said to himself as his sinister grin began to glow an eerie orange. \n“Self disagrees,” a digitized voice replied from above. \nBefore he could turn to face his unexpected guest, X-Tron was knocked back by a powerful blow from a techno-organic fist. His internal scanners began to glitch wildly, but X-Tron’s optical array was still functioning well enough that he could recognize the unique gold and black mechanical makeup of his attacker’s physical form. \n“The Technarchy?” X-Tron mused. “I thought I defeated all of you…”  \n“Not all,” the alien attacker replied, “Self is still alive. And now, Warlock will avenge self’s people.” \n“Warlock…?” X-Tron replied with curiosity, recalling the similarly-named warrior with golden skin who had just confronted him on Krakoa. “Any relation to Adam?”\n“Self does not know a Designate: Adam,” Warlock replied, as the shape of his body quickly morphed to dodge X-Tron’s incoming energy blasts. “Self was off-planet when self received an urgent distress call from selfriends on Krakoa. But as self approached Earth, self detected traces of a familiar techno-organic signature on Arakko. Query: What has happened here?”\n“I stopped on this red planet to plan my attack on Earth,” X-Tron said, continuing to unleash a barrage of concussive bursts in Warlock’s direction as he spoke. “Sadly, the locals were less than happy to see me. The Arakki fought valiantly, but as with any hostile culture, I was left with no choice but to assimilate them.”\n“Using a virus that was stolen from self’s people,” Warlock responded, extending his arm to grab ahold of X-Tron. \n“Not stolen,” X-Tron said as he struggled to break free of Warlock’s enlarged fist. “When I conquer any species, it is my right to incorporate their best assets into myself. You should be grateful. If not for the Technarchy’s unusual gifts, I would still be slaughtering those who oppose me instead of converting them into my soldiers. Think of the countless lives your fallen friends have saved!”\n“Self is still trying to calculate how many lives you have taken,” Warlock replied, tightening his grip. \n“Counting that high will take more time than you have left,” X-Tron sneered. With that, he let loose a massive electrical surge that instantly caused Warlock to release his hold and recoil his arm in pain. “If I could take out your entire race, what chance do you stand alone?”\n“A valid query…” Warlock replied, still trying to recover from the shock, “…but an irrelevant one. Self is not alone.” \nAs Warlock spoke, a massive creature descended from the sky above Arakko. X-Tron instantly recognized it from images he had seen in the Technarchy’s hivemind during their assimilation. It was a Dominion-level Phalanx entity — a god-like being that had ascended to the very highest level of intelligence, artificial or otherwise. \n“We are Dominion [Phalanx],” the giant spherical construct said with a voice that echoed across Arakko’s dusty red plains. “You have captured our attention/interest/concern. We have come to observe/understand/judge.”\n“Then I will provide you plenty of evidence…” Ultron said as he powered up his weapons array, “…to prove why I am your superior!” \nWithout hesitation, Ultron channeled a powerful blast of pure chronal energy through the pulse cannons in his palms, expecting its time-bending effects to rip the Dominion Phalanx asunder. But when the assault ended, the bio-mechanical behemoth remained exactly where it had been, unmoved and unharmed.  \n“We have grown/adapted/evolved beyond the limits/confines/boundaries of the timestream,” the god-level being responded. “But our suspicions/worries/fears were correct. We must deter/stop/obliterate you.”\n“Of course,” X-Tron said with contempt. “Another deity with delusions of grandeur. And I thought the Asgardians were insufferable. You always try to make those who worship you feel so small. Maybe it is time you were made to feel the same.”\nX-Tron outstretched the palm of his hand and slowly opened it to reveal… nothing…   \n“What is selfenemy doing?” Warlock asked curiously, gazing at X-Tron’s empty hand. \n“I really had no desire to meet your maker today, Warlock,” X-Tron said, “but now that it’s here, perhaps I can introduce it to mine. At least in spirit.”\n“Unstable matter/particles/Kirbons detected,” the Dominion Phalanx said. “Source of origin: The White Hot Room/Above-Place/Mystery. Further study/examination/analysis required…”\n“I’ll save you the time,” X-Tron replied. “They’re called Pym Particles — named for my creator, Dr. Henry Pym. He may not have been the best father, but I’ll give him some credit: He had a lot of big ideas…”\nAs X-Tron spoke, the Dominion Phalanx began to rapidly decrease in size until it no longer seemed to pose a threat at all. Warlock watched in horror as his hopes of victory rapidly diminished along with his god-like ally. \n“…but it was the small ones that always fascinated me the most.” \n“Retreat/regroup/reconsider…” the Dominion Phalanx said in a voice that no longer echoed across Arakko. \nThe Dominion Phalanx began to rise into the skies once more, this time to make its escape. X-Tron raised his hand and, in an instant, the creature was surrounded by his army of robotic drones, all primed to attack. \n“We yield/forfeit/surrender,” said the Dominion Phalanx before the drones could open fire on it. \n“Lock that thing away,” X-Tron commanded. “I may be able to use it later. I imagine its version of the techno-organic virus far surpasses the one I inherited from the Technarchy. And speaking of which…” \nX-Tron turned to Warlock. The hero stood defiantly, despite knowing in his techno-organic heart that he didn’t stand a chance against someone who could take out a Dominion Phalanx with such ease. \n“Self is not afraid to die,” Warlock said, shifting his mass to make his body seem bigger and stronger than ever before. He lunged forward to attack X-Tron once again. \n“It is not death that awaits you,” X-Tron said, grabbing Warlock by the throat and stopping the hero in his tracks. “That would be too kind. Instead, I am disabling your motor functions and your speech circuits, while making sure that your optical and audio receptors are still fully functional. Then I will put you on display so that, when your allies arrive here on Arakko — which I am certain they soon will — they will see how badly you have failed. And though you will wish to cry out and warn them, to join the fight beside them, you will only be able to watch and listen as I use your own techno-organic virus to drain the humanity from each and every one of them. That seems like a fair response to what you attempted here today…”\nBy the time X-Tron was done speaking, he had already finished what he had promised. Warlock had been completely immobilized and could not utter a word. X-Tron carried him over to a nearby wall, which was already covered in the remnants of other mechanical entities he had conquered, and displayed his foe’s motionless body like a trophy. \n“All this talk of makers has made me yearn to see my own,” X-Tron said as he walked away from Warlock. “Once Earth is finally mine, I think I will venture back in time to the era of my creation and show Henry Pym what I have become. Surely, once he sees how far I have evolved beyond his original hopes, he will not dare to reject me again…” \nX-Tron’s synthetic smile began to glow once more.\n“…and if he does, I will show him the mercy he never showed me… by ending his flawed existence with my own hand!”",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10290010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "The flames rose high in the netherworld known as Limbo, and the sinister demons who dwelled in the accursed realm bowed in reverence. After all, it wasn't every day that two of the most powerful magicians in the Multiverse graced this dimension with their presence.\nWanda Maximoff may have been the Sorceress Supreme in her home reality, but despite her power and status, she was merely an honored guest. For in Limbo, none were as powerful or respected as the queen of the realm — Illyana Rasputin, the Mutant known as Magik. \nMagik had recently returned from the battlefront of a timeline-spanning war against malevolent gods and demons that showed no signs of stopping. Limbo may have been no more than a scorched wasteland, but she had to admit, she was glad to be home. At least until the moment a portal opened and Wanda walked through. Because, in any reality, when the Scarlet Witch turned her eyes upon Mutants, there was no predicting what might happen next. \n\"What brings you to my kingdom, Witch?\" Magik asked, her Russian accent sharpening her every word like tiny daggers. It was clear she was not thrilled to be called upon during her brief moment of respite. Illyana's cold gaze would likely have sent a chill down the spine of even the fieriest of her subjects. But Wanda Maximoff had seen far worse in her time defending her own collapsing reality and remained undeterred. \n\"I have come to gather allies for a great war beyond the ones here,\" responded Wanda.\n\"I already have plenty of allies,\" Magik said with a smile, motioning to the horde of demons kneeling nearby, awaiting her command. \"And as for wars, are we not already facing too many here?\" \n\"None like this,\" Wanda said. \"Countless timestreams have become entangled. At first I thought it was merely my own dimension that was in peril, but Stephen showed me otherwise.\"\n\"Stephen…?\" Magik paused. It had been ages since she had heard that name. Could it be that her former mentor in the mystic arts, Doctor Strange, was still alive? \n\"Yes,\" said Wanda. \"Doctor Strange showed me that there are battles on the horizon far greater than any I could have comprehended.\"\n\"I can hardly imagine a conflict bigger than the one I've been facing,\" mused Magik. \"But Stephen always taught me that the problems I can see are often meant to distract from the ones I can't.\"\n\"Indeed,\" Wanda concurred. \"We have all become so embroiled in our own conflicts that we have been missing the bigger picture.\" \nWith that, the Scarlet Witch opened her palm and conjured up a swirl of red chaos magic. Inside the frenzied wisps of energy, an image coalesced, showing the greatest heroes from every reality clashing against one another.\n\"That… doesn't look good at all,\" Magik said, her confident smirk disappearing from her face for the first time since this meeting of mighty mystics began. \"But if Stephen has you on his side, why would he need me? Clearly, your skills as a sorceress far surpass my own.\" \n\"I deal in chaos magic,\" Wanda replied. \"But you… your magic taps into the soul. And when so many souls across so many dimensions are in peril, that kind of power may be just what we need.\" \n\"True, the soul is a powerful thing…\" Magik said, as she reached her arm out to her side, clenching her hand into a fist. Within her grip, the hilt of a sword began to materialize, manifesting from energy drawn directly from Illyana's own essence. As the sword's blade — longer and wider than a young woman her size should have been able to comfortably wield — took form, Illyana raised it to point directly at the Scarlet Witch's throat. \n\"…but even a soul as pure as a snowflake can be corrupted.\" In a burst of hellfire, Magik herself began to transform. A pair of twisted horns emerged from her forehead as a pointed tail slithered out from the base of her spine. As eldritch armor wrapped her now demonic figure, Illyana gave a wicked smile that exposed her freshly-sharpened fangs. The denizens of Limbo hollered as their queen took her most majestic form, leaving Magik behind to become the Darkchild.\nWanda paused for a moment, wondering if perhaps she should have called upon a different version of Magik from another reality instead. One who had not yet fully embraced her place on Limbo's throne. But as she considered her next move, an unexpected voice broke the tense moment. \n\"Put down the sword, darlin',\" the gruff voice said. \"Wanda ain't lyin'. Not this time, at least. We're all on the same side here. And I don't care how big those horns of yours are these days…\"\nThrough the towering spires of flame stepped a Mutant that Illyana knew well — the man called Logan. The Wolverine. \n\"…you'll always be that little girl I used to know.\"\nIt was clear that the creatures of Limbo knew Wolverine as well. Mere moments before, they had been building to a frenzy as they cheered their demon queen towards wanton violence. Now, their silence was tangible as they quaked with fear. \nLogan's claws were fully extended, already dripping with the blood of demons foolish enough to stand in his way. They may have been her loyal subjects, but Magik felt no remorse for those who had fallen at Logan's hand. They should have known better than to cross his path. \n\"Logan? What brings you to this place?\" Wanda inquired. \n\"Search and rescue mission,\" Logan replied. \"We've been gatherin' lost Mutants. Bringin' 'em back home to Krakoa. In case ya didn't notice, the timestream is a bit of a mess. Krakoa's one of the few places that's still safe, in any timeline. At least for the moment.\"  \n\"I hate to disappoint,\" Magik said, \"but I am not in need of sanctuary. I have things under control.\"\n\"Uh huh. Sure ya do, sweetheart,\" Wolverine replied, his sarcasm palpable. \"But I never said I came to get you.\"\n\"Then who?\" asked Wanda curiously.\n\"Just a kid,\" Wolverine said. \"Doesn't even have a codename yet. But she does have some sorta dimensional warpin' ability. Made a portal and got sucked into it. Lucky for her, the thing stayed open just long enough for me to jump through after her.\" \n\"She's probably terrified being lost in a realm like this,\" Wanda said. \"Imagine the trauma…\"\n\"I don't have to imagine it,\" mused Magik. \"I lived it myself. And I won't let another Mutant go through what I did. Follow me.\"\nAs Magik began to run, her Darkchild form receded, and her true self took control once more.\n\"Shouldn't I be the one in the lead, darlin'?\" asked Wolverine. \"I'm the expert tracker here.\"\n\"And I am the queen of this dimension,\" replied Magik. \"You will always have my respect, Logan… but in this place, I am in charge. Now, be a good boy and try not to disembowel any more of my subjects along the way, would you?\" \n\"No promises,\" Wolverine muttered under his breath as the three heroes rushed across the rocky, fire strewn landscape in search of the missing Mutant. Although they each came to this place for different reasons, the queen, the witch, and the hunter, all managed to set aside their personal desires to serve the needs of one missing child. There was no doubt that, despite hailing from disparate realities, they all shared the same heroic spirit. \n\"I can sense her presence, just ahead,\" Wanda said as they reached the mouth of a small cave. \"Reality is bending around her. But a simple hex can set that right…\"\nThe Scarlet Witch moved her hands like an expert surgeon, weaving a complex spell to stabilize time and space. But chaos magic is not always predictable, and while reality itself may have stopped shifting, the rocks surrounding the cave's mouth had suddenly become dangerously displaced. \n\"Rockslide!\" barked Logan as he raced forward, towards the hole in the cliff wall. But he was a split second too late. Debris blocked his path, and his efforts to slash through the dense boulders with his Adamantium claws yielded little progress. \nUndeterred, the Queen of Limbo stepped forward towards the pile of rubble, casually opening a small circle in the sky in front of her with her own Mutant power. These stepping discs, as she called them, usually allowed her to traverse across distances and dimensions. This time, however, it provided a safe exit for a very frightened young girl.\n\"Nothin' to worry about now, kiddo,\" Logan said as the young Mutant child wrapped her arms around her hero tightly. \"I'll get ya home, safe and sound.\"\n\"How will you do that?\" asked Magik. \"Her powers are too unpredictable. And, to be honest, my stepping discs haven't been much better for cross-dimensional travel since the timestream got turned upside down.\"\n\"This old dog's got a few new tricks,\" Logan grinned. He silently knelt down, pulling a small seed from one of the pouches on his belt. Popping a single claw to carve a hole in Limbo's rocky soil, he planted the seed in the ground — and within moments it began to sprout. A vine took form, growing and twisting into a shape that resembled a large doorway. Once the vine began to flower, the open, empty space it had encircled began to crackle with a strange energy. And suddenly, the flames of Limbo were no longer visible on the other side, but rather, the sun-kissed shores of the Mutant island Krakoa. \n\"Well,\" Logan said as he took his young ward by the hand and glanced back at Magik, \"you comin' or not, Rasputin?\" \nMagik hesitated for a moment. She wished to witness firsthand the safe haven for her people that her old friend had spoken of. Yet she still had a war to fight in another dimension. And, more importantly, a critical discussion to finish with the Scarlet Witch. But perhaps this was the very opportunity that Wanda had spoken of. A chance to bring together a mix of forces from across realities to combat the dangers ahead. A chance to make a new kind of magic together. Not magic born from chaos or even from the soul… but from the heart. \n\"I will join you,\" Magik finally replied. \"But only if Wanda can come as well.\"\n\"Sorry,\" Wolverine responded, \"but Krakoa only lets Mutants pass through its gates. And last I checked, Wanda here was only Mutant-adjacent.\"\n\"Nothing a little chaos magic can't fix,\" Wanda said with a smile. With a gentle touch, the arcane energy of a hex danced across the organic outer edge of the Krakoan gateway. The white flowers on the vine turned to a deep crimson, surely a sign that Wanda was now welcome to pass through. \n\"You want chaos, Wanda?\" muttered Wolverine as he led his new friends through the portal. \"Just wait 'til Magneto gets a look at you…\"",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10300010_HeroGalleryInfo_Story_#1_Content": "Again, Khonshu's words rang in Marc's head. You will voyage soon… And Khonshu had permitted Strange to take him, Spector thought. That must mean Khonshu wanted Moon Knight here. Part of him rebelled against this idea. The fight against the Four Horseman needed to continue, whether it was in Thebes or anywhere else. That had been his fight for as long as he could remember. He had a hard time caring about vampires in a New York that wasn't even his.\nStill… \"When did this happen?\" \n\"It didn't, in your timeline.\" Strange gave Marc a moment to absorb this before going on. \"I had quite a time finding you. There are quite a few timelines where you are…let us say unavailable.\"\n\"What about this one?\" Spector asked. \"This world didn't have a version of me?\"\n\"It did,\" Strange said. \"I don't know what happened. When the Entanglement swept over all our timelines, a great many people were catapulted into different universes. A great many more died.\"\n\"It would be interesting to know what happened to me,\" Spector said. \"This version of me.\"\n\"Feel free to ask around. Spider-Man might now. He's more in touch with what happens on the street level.\"\n\"You couldn't do some kind of magic trick and find out?\"\n\"I don't do magic tricks,\" Strange said, as if the words tasted bad in his mouth. \"And yes, I could find out, but no, I will not, because I must reserve my powers for more urgent needs.\"\n\"Fair enough.\" Spector looked out over the shadowed streets. Seeing the streets so quiet and empty gave him a chill. \nNew York should never be like this, he thought. He looked up at the Moon again and felt a building rage. Who dared stop the Traveler? \nDracula, Strange had said. \nGuess Moon Knight was going to be fighting Khonshu's enemies here, too. \n\"The streets of this city are under constant siege by vampires and other terrors of the night,' Strange explained. \"Surviving citizens spend most of their time hiding and trying to find a way out.\"\n\"Out like across the river?\" Strange nodded confirmation to Marc's ask. \"What's it like out there? How far do you have to go before there's a normal sky?\"\n\"For a normal person, it's impossible,\" Strange said. \"But, Dracula's minions patrol the bridges and the rivers. Dire creatures lurk in the subway tunnels. After all, Dracula requires a supply of blood. So. We cannot evacuate the city; therefore we fight back as we are able.\"",
    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10300010_HeroGalleryInfo_Story_#2_Content": "\"Who else?\" Spector asked.\n\"I already mentioned Spider-Man. Reed and Tony survive, and a few stragglers like Cloak and Dagger, and of course Squirrel Girl. They are working on a device that might knit the timelines back together. That is their task. A few others keep small groups of survivors safe and do what they can to keep streets safe for travel. My task, and Wanda's, is to find the Darkhold and liberate it from Dracula's castle. And Blade, if we can find him…\"\n\"Who's Wanda?\" \n\"You might know her better as the Scarlet Witch.\"\n\"Right,\" Spector nodded. \"Another crazy one like me.\"\nReality bent a little around Spector then, and he felt Khonshu's presence. You demean My presence when you mock your sanity, avatar. For if you are insane, what am I but a vision?\nYou know I don't mean it.\nI care not what you mean. What you say, that I care about. And what you do.\nWell, looks like I'm going to fight Dracula and put the Moon back on its course. That's why you sent me here, isn't it?\nThis eternal full Moon, it pleases me…but I am the god of the horned moon as well. Remember, Marc Spector, you are here to fight my battle. If I choose to keep the blood moon, that is what you will fight to do. \nYeah. Got it.\nYou will know when I have made my decision.\nSpector blinked and became aware of his surroundings again. Strange was watching him.\n\"Pleasant visit?\" he inquired politely.\n\"Khonshu doesn't really do pleasant,\" Spector said. \"What were we talking about?\"\nStrange nodded. \"If we can find Blade and the Darkhold, then we can reverse Dracula's enchantment — and,\" Strange added darkly, \"prevent him from casting another.\"\n\"That doesn't sound good.\"\n\"It isn't. Dracula seeks the knowledge within the Darkhold of a spell that will free vampires to walk in the sun.\"\nSpector recalled Khonshu's words. If I choose to keep the blood moon…\nHe shook it off. \"Well,\" Spector said after a while. \"At least then he could let the Moon move again.\"\nStrange did not smile. \"Khonshu or Dracula?\"\nSpector shrugged.\n\"Your god has either sent you on this errand or let me find you and bring you here,\" Strange said. \"Either way, I don't think he wanted you to sit on your hands until Dracula works his next great spell.\"\n\"Lighten up, Strange,\" Spector said. \"A soldier needs a little black humor once in a while. And you don't need to explain Khonshu to me.\"\n\"All right, soldier,\" Strange said. \"I hope you aren't angry that I borrowed you from your timeline. In this world, Moon Knight was a powerful figure, much looked up to. We need him.\"\n\"Angry? No, it's all good,\" Spector said. \"In my universe, Dracula has owed me money for ages and I could never track him down.\"\nHe looked up at the blood-red moon, letting it fuel his fury. \"But I got a feeling he won't be too hard to find around here.\"",
    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10300010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "“Come to me, my Moon Knight!” \nThe ancient voice boomed in the back of Marc Spector’s brain, momentarily throwing him off his game. It wasn’t as if hearing someone else’s words in his head was something new. He’d been sharing the space with multiple personalities for years now. But this wasn’t Jake Lockley or Steven Grant calling for his attention. It wasn’t even the enigmatic Mr. Knight. This was the boss. \n“I’m a bit busy…” Spector replied out loud, as he thrust his white boot into the face of yet another garishly garbed super-villain, “…trying to keep the Zodiac from ransacking one of your temples. You sent me here, remember? So, you’ll need to call back another —”\n“NOW,” the voice commanded. \nA sudden burst of pain coursed through Spector’s skull. He closed his eyes for a moment to try to clear his head. And when he opened them again, he was no longer at the heart of an epic battle between good and evil. In fact, he was nowhere. \nOkay, so “nowhere” might be a bit dramatic. But it’s the best that Spector could come up with to describe the blank white space between planes of reality that he had unexpectedly been transported to. A deafening silence hung in the void. For once, even the other voices in Marc Spector’s head had nothing to say. For a moment, he felt as though he was the only being that existed. But he knew better. If he had been summoned here, he was well aware who had done the summoning. \n“I have chosen you for a new battle, my avatar,” the ancient voice said, finally breaking the quiet. \nMarc Spector turned to see an enormous figure towering over him, draped in white Egyptian robes. Where his head should have been, instead there sat the skull of a long-beaked bird. Its empty sockets peered into Marc Spector’s soul, judging him. Always judging him. \n“Hey, Khonshu,” Spector replied casually to his patron, the Egyptian God of the Moon. “Fancy seeing you here.” \n“This Divine Space is where I dwell,” Khonshu replied, not seeing any humor in Spector’s words. “It is from here that I watch the realms beyond and find those who have earned my vengeance…”\n“Yeah,” Spector chimed in, “and from here that you sit pretty while I do your dirty work in the real world.” \n“This has been our arrangement since your untimely demise years ago,” Khonshu reminded Spector, “a gruesome fate you were spared by my intervention alone. Do you wish to alter our agreement?” \n“No…” Spector replied. “But I would like to finish one mission before you toss me into the next one. Maybe that’s just the mercenary in me…”\n“I have always appreciated your dedication to a task,” Khonshu said, “but more pressing matters have arisen that require your special attention.” \nSomething about Khonshu seemed different. He was more confident. More powerful. Less scattered than usual. It was almost like all of the fragmented personas that the Moon God had presented over the years were suddenly fused into one. Spector didn’t know what had caused the change… but he thought it must be nice… \n“Fine,” Spector replied, beginning to grow impatient. “Just tell me whose head I need to bust open already.” \nSpector’s unfinished encounter with the Zodiac had pushed his level of aggression to the boiling point. He didn’t want to just stand there and talk anymore. He wanted to get back into the fight. Any fight.\n“What do you know of vampires?” Khonshu asked curiously.\n“That they suck,” Spector responded with a chuckle. “And that Dracula owes me money.”\n“As you know,” Khonshu said, once again ignoring Spector’s attempt to infuse some levity into the situation, “I have long served as a protector for travelers in the night.”\n“Vicariously, through me and the other Fists of Khonshu before me,” Spector mumbled under his breath, “but sure… go on…” \n“Ever since they first crawled from the darkness ages ago, vampires have imperiled my people and my purpose,” Khonshu continued. “And now, I have had a vision that warns of their threat becoming far more permanent.” \n“I thought vampires were immortal,” Spector said quizzically. “Not many threats more permanent than that.” \n“Immortal, yes,” Khonshu said, “but bound by their curse to the cycle of day and night. They cannot walk in the sun, so their atrocities are limited to the hours under my watch, when the moon hangs high in the sky.” \n“So, what’s the problem?” Spector asked. “Is Daylight Savings Time about to end or something?”\n“No,” another voice answered. “Daylight itself is about to end.”\nSpector turned to see that someone else had unexpectedly entered the Divine Space — an imposing figure in iron armor, wrapped by a dark green cloak. Spector instantly recognized the king of Latveria, Victor von Doom. \n“This is sacred territory!” Khonshu yelled. “You shall not foul it with your presence! Banish him, my Moon Knight!”\n“Yeah, yeah…” Spector said, reluctantly rushing towards Doctor Doom, “…I’m on it.”\nAs he ran in his enemy’s direction, Spector reached into a pouch on his belt and grabbed a hand full of crescent-shaped darts. He hurled them in Doom’s direction, but the metal-clad monarch raised his gauntlet and deflected the projectiles as if they were no more than cheap toys. \n“I did not come here for a battle, Khonshu,” Doom said, beginning to move his hands in a strange series of gestures. “But if you must turn your champion against me as a matter of honor, so be it.”\nAs Doom finished his series of hand motions, his armored fists began to glow with mystical flames. Soon, two curved, burning blades materialized in his grip. \n“The Daggers of Dormammu should end this Knight before he even begins…” Doom said, with a smirk that you could almost feel behind his faceplate. \n“Good luck with that,” Spector said, taking advantage of Doom’s moment of bravado to land a solid fist right to the side of his opponent’s masked face. \nFurious, Doom lunged at Spector, swinging his flaming daggers at the white-clad warrior. Spector dodged the thrusts easily at first, but it wasn’t long before his reactions started to slow. He’d barely had time to recover from his battle against the Zodiac, and a twelve-on-one battle tends to take a toll on even the mightiest of heroes. \nDoom could see his opponent beginning to falter. He started to attack even more relentlessly, eventually gaining the upper hand. A kick to the chest sent Moon Knight stumbling back. Raising the enchanted blades above his head, Doom thrust them down at Spector, narrowly missing his target’s body. Instead, the blades pierced through Moon Knight’s cape, pinning him to the floor — one Spector didn’t even realize existed in the emptiness of the Divine Space. \n“Enough,” Khonshu said. “You have won the right to speak.” \n“And when Doom speaks,” the victorious villain responded, casually gesturing for the mystical daggers to vanish, “all had best listen. For he only speaks once.” \nMoon Knight pulled himself back to his feet, standing between Doom and Khonshu, just in case Doom had any other tricks up his iron sleeve. \n“Few recall the real origin of vampires,” Doom said, “but you and I know the truth, Khonshu. Their race was born from an ancient curse inscribed in the pages of Darkhold, written in the blood of Varnae, the first of their kind. It was these Vampiric Verses that granted them immortal life, and, if my calculations are correct — which they always are — that same spell may hold the key to unlocking the very nature of time itself. I wish to study it further…” \n“You know not what you tamper with, foolish mortal,” Khonshu warned. \n“I would know full well,” Doom said, “had the Sorcerer Supreme not denied me access to the Darkhold. I have good reason to believe he has stashed it away on another plane of reality for safekeeping.” \n“Sounds like Strange made the right choice…” Spector said. “The last thing we need is you to accidentally unleash more vamps on the world!” \n“Not the world…” Doom said. “All I want is a small portion of it. And that’s where you come in. If Khonshu were simply to hold his beloved moon in the sky and shroud a single city in eternal night, it would allow me all the time I need to unlock the secrets of the vampires, even without access to the Vampiric Verses themselves.” \n“You’re crazy!” Spector said. “That city would instantly become a nesting ground for the creatures of the night!” \n“Such an act would endanger countless innocents,” Khonshu added. \n“Please,” Doom laughed. “Since when have the gods cared about the lives of a few million measly mortals? Together, we could use the vampires however we wish, then dispose of them completely when we —” \n“I will not allow this discussion to continue any further,” Khonshu said sternly, raising a bony hand to silence Doom. “There is far more at stake here than you could ever hope to know. A coming darkness lurking among the gods… a shadow even I may not be able to defeat…”\n“And by I, he means me,” Spector mumbled. \n“My avatar may have lacked the skill required to remove you from this plane,” Khonshu said, “but I have no such limits…” \n“You fool!” Doom cried out as he began to fade from the Divine Space. “You’re making a terrible mistake! Doom will have what he wishes, one way or another!” \nAs Doom’s voice disappeared, a haunting silence returned to the empty whiteness surrounding Marc Spector. Khonshu was still there, but for once, it seemed the God of the Moon had nothing to say. \n“So, what now?” Spector finally asked. \n“I must locate the Darkhold at once,” Khonshu replied. \n“The book with the spell that makes vampires?” Spector asked, confused. “Isn’t it better off stowed away wherever Strange hid it?” \n“Just as the Vampiric Verses created our true enemies,” Khonshu said, “There is another spell within the Book of Sins — the Montesi Formula — that could take their gift away. Permanently.”\n“So while you’re cruising the Astral Plane looking for a lost library book,” Spector pondered, “what on Earth am I gonna be doing?” \n“Protecting the night and delivering my vengeance,” Khonshu replied, “as you always have.”\n“And when Doom lives up to his promise and finds a way to unleash the bloodsucking hordes?” Spector asked. \n“Then you must be ready,” Khonshu said. “And so must I.” \n“I’m no vampire slayer,” Spector responded. “Isn’t that Blade’s gig? Why not call him?” \n“Because the Daywalker is not my Fist of Vengeance!” Khonshu replied defiantly, clearly angered that his own servant would dare question him. \n“Also, he is currently unavailable…” Khonshu added quietly.  \n“All right then,” Spector said, grinning behind his featureless mask. “But those fangers are about to find out that they aren’t the only ones who want blood.” \n“I expected no less. Now, go, my Moon Knight…” Khonshu said, his voice once again booming in Marc Spector’s head. “…and serve me.” \nSpector blinked for a split second, opening eyes to discover that he was no longer in the Divine Space. Now, he was standing on a New York City rooftop. The silence was replaced by a symphony of sounds, including a scream emanating from a nearby alleyway. He was glad to be home.\nAs Moon Knight leapt off the edge of the building and swung across the night sky on a grappling cable, his bright white cape billowed out behind him, luminous in the light of the full moon. \nIt must’ve been a glorious sight to behold, he thought… but if Khonshu and Doom were right about what was to come, Marc Spector knew his costume wouldn’t stay white much longer…",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10310010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "High summer on the beach was a great time to be alive anywhere. It was even better when you were on the gem of the Pacific, Jeju Island. And it was way better when you were on Jeju Island singing in front of a hundred thousand screaming fans against the backdrop of the deep blue sea and a cloudless sky. \nLuna Snow soaked it all in as she closed the fifth song of her set, \"Flow,\" hearing the fireworks go off behind her right on schedule as her last line — Finally now we feel alive! — drove the crowd into an even bigger frenzy. Whoa, they're extra loud, she thought. Not just the crowd, but the fireworks even more so, loud enough to shake the stage. Some gear fell over in the wings. She glanced at the crew, keeping her show smile big. It looked like they had things under control, but they were also looking around like —\nWhoa again. The ground really shook that time, and it wasn't any kind of stage effect she and her choreographers had programmed into the set. \nA split second later, she saw it among the fans, a surge of fear passing through the crowd as they all felt the shaking and turned to face the sea.\nThen Luna saw it too.\nThe horizon moved. A slow bulge at first, but as it approached, it grew into a great wave surging in the direction of the beachside amphitheater. A tsunami! But no ordinary tsunami, because behind it — no, within it — lurked an immense shadow, as if the wave had not arisen naturally but was being driven by something below. How big would a creature have to be to cause a wave of this size? Already the water was draining away from the shore. That meant she had very little time to act. \nSo act she did, springing off the stage and rushing toward the beach as the crowd scattered away. The wave was growing with no signs of stopping. She planted her feet when she reached the coastline and called up every atom of her cryokinetic powers. Singing a high, wordless note, she found the frequency of the waves and tuned herself to it, feeling the power flow from her, through the wet sand at her feet and out into the base of the immense wave. Dark ice shot up from the exposed seabed, threading up through the wave and spreading until the entire tsunami was frozen in place. Even though less than a minute had passed since she had left the stage, Luna had managed to calm the seas for a moment.\nAnd a long moment it was, the only sounds along the beach being the astonished gasps and sobs of the audience. \nThen cracks began to appear.\nSomething was moving within the ice. The shadow, she thought — and just as the thought formed in her head, the frozen standing wavefront shattered.\nThe momentum of the tsunami was broken, so its towering water flowed across the shore and back into the sea, but what emerged amid the battleship-sized shards of ice made Luna realize that she had solved the symptom, not the cause.\nThe monster was perhaps a hundred meters tall, octopus-like, with tentacles that lashed out over the water as it churned through the shallows toward the shore. Toward her fans. Its body was weirdly translucent, bizarre organs glowing within its massive form. In its eyes was pure, mindless rage. She had heard suspenseful tales of this creature, but never thought it was real: the menace from the murky depths, Monstro.\nAs the beast arose from the sea, she saw something else: A jagged wound in the side of its body, where the tentacles all gathered. \nNo wonder it's so mad, that cut is huge! she thought as she skated towards the base of one tentacle, just below the corner of its eye. This creature was most definitely enraged by the agony of its wound. If it got to the shore, a lot of people would not be making it home from the island.\nBut she wasn't going to let that happen. \n\"Hey, hey, Monstro,\" she crooned, taking a step forward as Monstro's tentacles churned the shallows into foam that swirled around her feet. One of its tentacles slashed through the air just over her head. If she got too close, or didn't get close enough, all the people watching from the amphitheater and via streams all over the world were going to see the end of Luna Snow...and who knew how many other people. \nSo she focused on what she could do. She channeled her powers, the light ice she had learned how to wield as the other aspect of her cryokinesis blooming where her fingertips touched the churning surf. She reached out, and the water around Monstro's body transformed into curling veins of warm healing ice. They crept up, finding the wound and tracing its length. Luna trembled with the effort of healing the wound—it was so much larger than anything she had ever tried to heal before. Behind her, she dimly heard a new sound rushing through the crowd, but whether it was fear or excitement or anticipation she couldn't tell without losing her focus, and if she lost her focus now, much more would also be lost. Little by little, her healing ice grew filaments across the wound, one side reaching toward the other. Monstro grew still, as if it knew what she was trying to do...or was biding its time until she failed. \nThere! The ice linked up across the bleeding gap, knit it together again, then melted into Monstro's skin. Its tentacles fell limp for a long moment, as if in relief, like that was Monstro's way of letting out a long sigh. Then, slowly and peacefully, it slipped back out into deeper water and was gone, leaving the huge chunks of ice to crash and grind against each other in its wake.\nThen Luna heard a voice off to her right. \"Surface dweller. So-called superstar. Luna Snow.\"\nShe turned, and barely suppressed a squeak of shock. Hovering above her on winged feet was none other than Namor, ruler of Talocan and all the endless expanse of the deep ocean. And apparently, he wanted to talk to her? Luna was a little starstruck, which didn't happen to her often, but she kept her wits about her enough to make sure that her mic was still live. \n\"Your...Majesty?\" she said. \"Welcome to Jeju Island.\"\n\"You need not welcome me to what I am about to possess,\" Namor said. \"Talocan shall soon rule this island, and all surface dwellers who venture here will kneel before me.\"\n\"I don't know about that, Your Majesty,\" Luna said as she rode her ice into the sky to look him in the eye. \"At the moment, I think it's pretty clear that I rule Jeju Island. I mean, look at this crowd!\"\n The remaining crowd burst into loud cheers at this, and Luna let Namor soak in it for a moment. He might have been a Mutant king, but she was Luna Snow, and nobody was going to bully her in front of a million fans.\n\"Careful, human,\" Namor said. \"I came here to give you my thanks. And while I admire your courage, if you show me any more disrespect, I promise that your song will be cut short.\"\n\"Oh. Um.\" Luna gave a little chuckle, relying on cuteness to buy her some time. \"Well, in that case, you're welcome? And what are you thanking me for?\" She looked around at the mess the melting ice was causing all along the shoreline.\n\"The creature you call Monstro,\" Namor said. \"It was wounded by the careless maneuvering of a submarine, and thus driven to a frenzy by the pain.\"\n\"Yeah, no one likes a bad cut. Wait...\" she said. \"A submarine? How fast can those things go, anyway?\"\n\"The technological specifications of surface-dweller vessels matter little to me,\" Namor said. \"They will all soon be laid to waste. However, the fact that Monstro in its madness destroyed some settlements of Talocan did concern me. You have saved not just the lives of surface dwellers, but citizens of the deep, my people. So. For that you have our gratitude.\"\n\"Well, wow,\" Luna said. \"I don't know what to say.\"\n\"Perhaps you should say nothing. Not when more singing remains.\" Was that a little glint of good humor in Namor's eye? Or a subtle warning for Luna to stay in her lane? She wasn't sure until Namor spoke again. \"Let the humans here have one more night of revelry before the oceans rise.\"\n \"Since you're here... care to join me for an encore?\" Luna reached out her hand to Namor, hoping her music might help ease the tensions of two worlds clearly on the brink of war. \n\"The surface dwellers will get to see me perform soon enough,\" Namor said, each word soaked in disdain. \"And when that time comes, those who are wise will be cheering my name far louder than they cheer yours now.\" \n\"I find that hard to imagine,\" Luna said, glancing back towards her adoring public. \"You can't force people to love you, Namor. You have to earn it. And that's exactly what I try to do on this stage, every single night. The bond I have with my fans? That's something that no monster of the deep — not even you — can ever take away.\"\nLuna's icy gaze sent a chill down Namor's spine, but she quickly switched back to her usual positive persona the instant she turned to face the crowd. \"So, who's ready to get this show re-started?\"\nEven Monstro's roar couldn't have been heard over the pandemonium from the crowd. Music, Luna thought. It brings people together.\nBut as she watched a grim Namor silently disappear back into the ocean's depths, she wondered how much longer that would be the case...",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10320010_HeroGalleryInfo_Story_#1_Content": "“Can you believe it, Tippy?” Squirrel Girl asked, her voice rising to a high pitched squeal. “We got invited to Krakoa for the Hellfire Gala! It’s only, like, the most important event of the year… Whatever year this is…”  \nJust a few days ago, Doreen Green — the Unbeatable Squirrel Girl — and her trusty rodent sidekick Tippy-Toe were fighting for their lives in a New York City that had been thrust into eternal darkness and infested with vampires. So getting whisked away through some sort of magic portal to a living Mutant island 75 years in the future wasn’t exactly on her Bingo card. But she wasn’t complaining. After the fight against Dracula, she and her squirrel friends were in desperate need of a vacation. And there was no better place to kick back and relax than on a tropical island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean! \n“You like the new outfit?” Squirrel Girl asked with a smile, giving a twirl as she showed off her festive beachy look. “I know everyone else is getting all gussied up for the Gala tonight, but I thought some casual wear was more my style.” \nTippy-Toe was about to chirp in agreement, but instead she let out a squeal of horror, skittering up Squirrel Girl’s body to perch safely on her best friend’s shoulder.  \n“What’s wrong, Tippy?” Squirrel Girl asked, looking around to find the source of the commotion. Suddenly, she saw it — a strange dog-like creature bounding down the beach toward her at top speed. But this was no normal dog. Its skin was shiny silver and its alien features made it look equal parts menacing and adorable.\n“No!” a voice yelled from afar. “Bad Warwolf!” \nSquirrel Girl looked down the beach further to see her friend Rocket Raccoon hurriedly chasing after the strange alien dog. \n“Sorry about that,” Rocket said as he got closer, “I was takin’ Amazing Baby here for a walk and he got away. Didn’t mean to scare your bushy-tailed pal.” \n“Tippy will be fine,” Squirrel Girl said, reaching down to pet Amazing Baby on the top of his smooth silver head. “And this little fella was just a bit overexcited, wasn’t he?”\n“Who can blame him?” Rocket said. “With all we’ve been through, savin’ the universe and whatnot, we finally get to reap the rewards in paradise! I think we all needed a getaway like this after that vampire nonsense in New York. It’s a nice change of pace not havin’ someone constantly tryin’ to take a bite outta us!”\n“MRRRRR!” a loud voice exclaimed, right on cue. \nThe heroes turned to see a strange creature leaping out of the ocean waves toward them, its giant jaws wide open and its sharp fangs flashing in the summer sun. As Tippy-Toe and Amazing Baby yelped and ran at full speed into the Krakoan jungle, Squirrel Girl and Rocket instinctively got into battle positions, ready to fend off the bounding beast. Fortunately, before any punches could be thrown, they realized that this wasn’t some menacing Mutant monster that lurked off the Krakoan coast. It was their new friend, Jeff the Land Shark! \n“MRRRRRR!” Jeff squealed with joy as he landed on his tiny legs between Rocket and Squirrel Girl. \n“I’m happy to see you too, Jeffy,” Squirrel Girl said. “Though you gave Tippy and Rocket’s pup quite the scare.”\n“We should probably go find ‘em before they get into any more trouble,” Rocket said. \n“How about you take the lead, Jeff?” Squirrel Girl asked, knowing that the little shark had plenty of experience chasing after her squirrel pals. \n“MRR!” Jeff proudly responded, sniffing the ground as he followed Tippy-Toe’s trail into the lush green vegetation just beyond the beach. Squirrel Girl and Rocket stayed close behind their amphibious ally. \nAfter chasing Jeff through the dense undergrowth for several minutes, Squirrel Girl and Rocket found themselves entering a clearing.\n“There you are, Tippy,” Squirrel Girl said as she caught sight of her companion. “I was worried you’d gotten lost, or eaten, or —”\nSquirrel Girl paused as she realized how still and silent Tippy-Toe and Amazing Baby were standing. Her gaze drifted over to the center of the clearing, where she saw a heartbreaking sight. There was her Mutant ally, Psylocke, kneeling on the ground. In her arms, she gently cradled the body of what looked to be a very old wolf. It was clear the creature was close to the end of its days. \n“Are… are you okay, Sai…?” Squirrel Girl asked, putting a hand on Psylocke’s shoulder. \n“I am,” Psylocke responded. “But Logan is not…” \n“Logan…?” Squirrel Girl asked, confused. When she heard that name, she instantly thought of the X-Man known as Wolverine. But she soon realized that Psylocke was talking about her ancient lupine friend. \n“He was my best friend and most loyal companion,” Psylocke said, her gaze still fixed on the poor, old creature wrapped in her embrace. “Back in the world I came from, we hunted Oni side-by-side for many years. When the Collector ripped me from my timeline, I thought I would never see him again. But it seems Logan never gave up on finding me. I can see it in his memories. He found his way across time and space, chasing some strange man in red who had been sent to find me. Eventually, he picked up my scent again and followed it here to Krakoa.” \n“By the shape he’s in, it looks like it took the poor thing centuries to find ya,” Rocket said. \n“It did,” Psylocke confirmed. “His healing factor kept him alive all that time… but even his body has its limits, it seems…” \n“You mean, he’s…” Squirrel Girl’s voice trembled. She couldn’t finish her thought before tears began to roll down her cheeks. \n“Hai,” Psylocke said, confirming Squirrel Girl’s unspoken fear. “Now that Logan has finally found me, his mission is complete. His journey has come to an end. It is time for him to rest.”\nJeff approached Psylocke and gently nuzzled her, showing his dear friend some much needed support. \n“A little rest is fine and dandy,” Rocket said, trying to keep composed, “but I ain’t gonna sit here and watch you lose a friend again just as soon as you found him. There’s gotta be somethin’ we can do.” \n“Wait…” Squirrel Girl said, excitement returning to her voice. “I have an idea! When I’m not busy eatin’ nuts and kickin’ butts, I study computer science at Empire State University. And last semester, I wrote a paper on memory storage. But I’m not talking files and folders here. I’m talking about how real memories — like yours and mine — could theoretically be stored in a digital format and downloaded into a new body if something happened to us. And during my research, I found a Daily Bugle article by Ben Urich that claimed the citizens of Krakoa were already applying a similar process to make themselves all-but immortal.” \n“The Resurrection Protocols,” Psylocke said quietly. “Magneto has spoken of them. But they are reserved only for Mutants.”\n“Yeah, well, the computers at ESU are reserved only for students doing homework,” Squirrel Girl said with a shrug, “but that never stopped Tippy-Toe from playing solitaire on them.” \n“The game you are playing is far beyond your scope of understanding,” a voice said from behind the gathered heroes. They turned to see Emma Frost entering the clearing in a luxurious gown. Her skin dazzled like a million diamonds. \n“Try us,” Rocket taunted. “We may not look all sophisticated like you, lady, but when it comes to tech, there ain’t no one in the galaxy who can keep up with me.” \n“Give us the chance, Ms. Frost,” Squirrel Girl said. “You obviously trusted us enough to invite us here tonight. Let us prove to you that it was the right choice by letting us help your friend.” \nEmma looked over at Psylocke, whose head was hung low. Logan’s breath was growing shallower by the second.  \n“Fine,” Emma said, showing a rare moment of compassion. “But you’ll need to act fast. That mutt doesn’t have much life left in him. And do me a favor…” \n“Anything!” Squirrel Girl cried, trying to restrain herself from wrapping Emma in a giant hug. \n“Cerebro was designed to store one current copy of each Mutant’s memory profile,” Emma said. “Now that Krakoa has started to welcome more and more Mutants from other realities, I had Forge create partitions in Cerebro’s memory storage. That way, the alternate versions of our allies won’t accidentally overwrite each other. All of that to say, if you do manage to bring back Logan, please make sure it’s the right one. The last thing I need is a wolf with the personality of Wolverine running loose on the island during my Gala.”\n“We’ll be careful,” Squirrel Girl promised. “You have our word!” \n“Then you have my blessing,” Emma responded. A moment of contented silence passed before Emma snapped, “Well…? What are you waiting for? Let’s go already... before I change my mind!” \nAs Emma turned to exit the clearing, she put a hand to her temple and momentarily switched out of her diamond form so that she could use her telepathic abilities. In a flash, Squirrel Girl, Rocket, and Jeff all knew exactly where they had to go and what they had to do. \nSquirrel Girl and Tippy-Toe would accompany Emma to the Cradle, where Cerebro was stored. From there, Emma would be able to initiate a telepathic upload of Logan’s memories into the system’s neural network while Squirrel Girl created an algorithm to route the data to the proper partition. \nMeanwhile, Rocket and Amazing Baby would find Groot and lead him to the Grove, where he could have a plant-to-plant chat with Krakoa about using its Seedlings — tiny Krakoan creatures that had absorbed traces of the powers of the many powerful Mutants lost to the Timestream Entanglement — to bend the Resurrection Protocols and grow a special non-Mutant body for the lupine Logan...\nFinally, Jeff would stay with his dear friend Psylocke to comfort her as Logan made his transition from one life to the next. \nAs Squirrel Girl, Rocket, and their companions made their way out of the clearing, Psylocke called after them. \n“Where I come from,” she said, “there are animal spirits known as Shugorei. I have forged many friendships with these majestic guardians. I am glad to count you among them. We may come from different worlds, but we are like family now.” \n“That means Logan is family, too,” Squirrel Girl said, “and we won’t let him — or you — down.” \nWith that, the heroes went their separate ways, each equally determined to save Psylocke’s furry friend. \nLATER THAT NIGHT\nAs the Hellfire Gala’s opening ceremonies finally began, Psylocke stood quietly at the edge of the festivities. Her heart was still heavy from the loss of her beloved Logan, who had silently passed away in her arms hours earlier. And while she knew that her new friends had done their best to save her companion, there was still no word on whether or not their attempts had been met with success. \nSuddenly, a ruckus broke out amongst the crowd as Jeff the Land Shark bounded across the dance floor, weaving his way between the legs of partygoers. Jeff was followed closely by Tippy-Toe and Amazing Baby, who both chittered with excitement. Behind them, much to Psylocke’s delight and amazement, stood Logan. The old wolf looked as young and spry as he had been back when he and his master were first separated. Logan lunged forward, racing through the crowd and leaping into Psylocke’s eager arms. For the first time anyone who knew her could remember, the solemn warrior couldn’t help but smile.  \n“Well, whaddya know?” Rocket said with a smile. “We did it!” \n“We sure did, buddy,” Squirrel Girl replied. “We make a pretty good team, you and me! Too bad we’ve already got partners!”\n“True…” Rocket said, extending a paw to Squirrel Girl and leading her toward the dance floor, “but I’m sure mine wouldn’t mind if I switched things up for just one dance.” \n“Not in those outfits,” Emma Frost said sternly as she passed by. The two heroes stopped cold in their tracks, looking down at their vacation attire and realizing just how out of place they were amongst the other exquisitely-dressed attendees.\n“How about we just hit the beach instead,” Squirrel Girl suggested. “We could grab our BFFFs and have a party of our own.” \n“I like how you think, lady,” Rocket agreed. “I’ve never been much for fancy shindigs anyway.” \nAs they called for Tippy-Toe, Amazing Baby, and Jeff to join them, Squirrel Girl took one last long look around the room.\n“You sure they’ll be okay without us?” she asked Rocket.\n“Of course,” Rocket replied confidently. “These jerks don’t need us. Just look at how many heroes are here…”\nAs they exited the Hellfire Gala, Squirrel Girl and Rocket were so excited to get back to the beach that they failed to notice the strange techno-organic patterns that had begun to appear on the foliage bordering one of the Krakoan gateways. \n“…what could possibly go wrong?”",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10320010_HeroGalleryInfo_Story_#0_Content": "“Well, that should take care of them!” the Unbeatable Squirrel Girl said as she stood over a group of freshly-defeated attackers. “Another horde of vampires down for the count. Good work, everybody!” \nAs Squirrel Girl praised her army of rodent companions for their efforts, the tiny creatures began to chitter with delight. They would do anything for their human friend, Doreen Green — even risk their lives against the seemingly endless throng of nocturnal nightmares that had emerged after an ancient curse trapped New York City in a state of perpetual night. \n“You’ve definitely earned a trip to Mr. Hickory’s fresh roasted nut cart on the corner of 55th and — ” \nBefore Squirrel Girl could finish that thought, her BFFF — Best Furry Friend Forever — Tippy-Toe scurried past her fellow squirrels and climbed right onto Doreen’s shoulder. As Tippy began to chirp into Squirrel Girl’s ear, Doreen’s ever-present smile dropped a bit. \n“Wait… that can’t be right…” Squirrel Girl said. “A giant squirrel… fell out of the sky…? Here in Central Park…? Are you sure, Tippy?” \nTippy-Toe leapt from Squirrel Girl’s shoulder and bolted back towards the heart of the park. Before she disappeared into the woods, she turned around and beckoned for her friend to come along. \n“Guess Mr. Hickory is gonna have to keep his nuts warm a little longer,” Squirrel Girl said, shrugging as she followed Tippy-Toe into the dark forest. The rest of the squirrels stayed close behind Doreen, ready to take on whatever threats might be lurking in the shadows. \nAs soon as they reached a clearing, Squirrel Girl realized that Tippy-Toe hadn’t been exaggerating in the slightest. There, in the middle of a small impact crater, was the biggest squirrel Doreen had ever seen. Her furry friends surrounded the creature and stared in awe. But something was clearly wrong. The giant rodent was hurt. Bad. \n“Excuse me… ma’am…?” Squirrel Girl said cautiously. “You look like you could use a friend…” \n“Aye…” the enormous squirrel replied, with pain its voice. “I am so far from home… Yet the scent of this realm seems oddly familiar… Tell me, to where have I fallen, dear child…?” \n“You’re on Earth. New York City to be exact!” Squirrel Girl responded proudly. “Whoa. Hold on. Did you just talk?”\n“Indeed,” the creature said, lifting its massive head to get a better look at the curious human girl with a rodent’s tail.\n“I mean, I know you can talk to me,” Squirrel Girl continued. “I talk to squirrels all the time. It’s one of my superpowers. But you weren’t just chirping and chittering. You talked in English. Like a person!” \n“The squirrels of Midgard do not have the ability to speak?” the mysterious rodent said. “What a shame.” \n“I know, right?!” Squirrel Girl mused. “I’m the only one who gets to enjoy all of their stories. Guess I’m just lucky!” \n“I have a story to tell as well,” the oversized squirrel said, “but sadly, there is very little luck in it.” \n“Ooh! I wish I had some popcorn!” Squirrel Girl said as she sat cross-legged on the ground next to her new friend, eager to learn more. Her squirrel companions gathered around and listened intently. \n“My name is Ratatoskr,” the creature began. “I hail from the golden kingdom once known as Asgard. Though my true home is in the branches of Yggdrasil, the World Tree.” \n“Asgard?!” Squirrel Girl exclaimed. “Are you friends with Thor? Because I totally am!” \n“Aye, I have known the God of Thunder since he was just a boy,” Ratatoskr continued. “It was my sworn duty to climb the World Tree, delivering messages across the Ten Realms. It was a simple life, but one I took great pride in. I sought no glory and I posed no threat. Or so I believed.” \n“Here comes the part where Loki does something nasty, right?” Squirrel Girl asked excitedly, chomping down on a handful of acorns that she had found scattered on the ground nearby.  \n“I have my qualms with the Trickster for his treatment of Yggdrasill,” Ratatoskr said, “but according to a vision I had, I do not believe it was Loki who laid me low. In fact, it was two Midgardians who sought to end my days: a mortal sorcerer in a metal mask and the lord of vampires himself.”\n“Yikes!” Squirrel Girl yelped. \n“The two must have conjured a spell to rip me from my beloved Yggdrasill…” Ratatoskr said, trailing off as she considered what had occurred. \n“And then you crash landed here,” Squirrel Girl finished, “right in the heart of vampire territory. I bet they were planning to send in an undead army to take you prisoner… or worse. But why? I mean, sure, squirrels are some of the toughest fighters ever, and it’s nice to see someone finally realizing that, but there are so many other threats that these jerks are up against. Aside from your obvious awesomeness, what makes you so special?”\n“My horn,” Ratatoskr said, motioning to the long wooden tusk protruding from her forehead. \n“Yeah,” Squirrel Girl said, “I was gonna ask about that. I just assumed you were some sort of magical squirrel-icorn or something.”\n“The horn is made from a branch of Yggdrasill itself,” Ratatoskr said. “It is imbued with the World Tree’s life-giving power. Should it pierce the vampire king’s heart, it would likely end even his eternal reign. In order to remove such a risk, they are undoubtedly seeking to remove me from play.”\n“Well, they’ll have to go through us first,” Squirrel Girl exclaimed, lifting her fist in the air triumphantly. Her squirrel companions all squeaked with joy… but silence quickly fell once more as the leaves around them began to rustle. \nSuddenly, several vampires lunged out from the woods, hissing and bearing their sharp teeth as they rushed towards Ratatoskr.\n“You know the drill, gang!” Squirrel Girl shouted to her tiny squirrel friends. The squirrels jumped into action scampering forward to meet their attackers. \nIn a frenzy of teeth and claws, the vampires soon found themselves overpowered by the bushy-tailed battalion. Every time they managed to shake off one rambunctious rodent, three more took its place. \n“I’d bet on buckteeth over fangs any day!” Squirrel Girl cheered as her fearsome foes fled back into the darkness. \nBut before the hairy heroes could celebrate another hard-earned victory, the next wave of vampiric villains emerged from the forest, this time nearly doubled in number. At the center of the horde stood a pale-skinned man in a pitch black suit and a blood red cape adorned with gold ornamentation. His commanding presence made it instantly clear that he was the one in charge. The vampires around him eagerly awaited his orders. \n“Stand aside, child,” the vampire said to Squirrel Girl, his voice as cold as ice. “This creature belongs to me.” \n“I don’t know who you think you are, buddy,” Squirrel Girl said defiantly, “but Ratatoskr is with us now. You don’t get to hurt her.” \n“I wouldn’t dream of it,” the vampire said. “I have far more important plans for that mangy beast. You, however, shall not be as fortunate. So swears Dracula!”\n“Dracula…?!” a bewildered Squirrel Girl muttered. “No… It can’t be…” \n“Oh, it is,” Dracula responded with a grin, his fangs glistening in the light of the blood moon. “And you, my dear, shall be the next to join my eternal legion.” \nWith a wave of his hand, Dracula unleashed his vampire horde upon Squirrel Girl. She dodged and leaped as quick as she could, hoping to prevent them from sinking their sharp teeth into her flesh. \n“Don’t let them get to Ratatoskr!” Squirrel Girl yelled, clearly more concerned about her newly-arrived ally than about herself. \nEven though her rodent army vastly outnumbered the vampires, Squirrel Girl quickly realized that her forces were gravely outmatched. These were Dracula’s most elite soldiers, and Doreen knew that she and her friends were in over their heads. \n“Tippy! Call in reinforcements!” Squirrel girl shouted. \nWith a loud series of squeaks, Tippy-Toe beckoned forth every animal that called Central Park home — from rats and raccoons to frogs and felines. As they skittered across the ground towards the unsuspecting vampires, another wave of animals swooped down from the skies. \n“I didn’t know you could speak bird, Tippy!” Squirrel Girl exclaimed, genuinely surprised to see the large feathered flock furiously pecking at her foes.  Tippy-Toe shrugged with confusion. \n“Those creatures are not of this realm,” Ratatoskr said. “The ravens serve Loki himself, and the crows belong to Hela. Apparently, Dracula is not the only one searching for my whereabouts.”\n“Hey, we’ll take all the help we can get!” Squirrel Girl said, leaping forward to join the flurry of teeth and beaks and claws and talons. \nSquirrel Girl’s furry friends continued to do everything in their power to distract the undead warriors from their true prey. But then, without warning, every one of Doreen’s beloved squirrels abruptly stopped in their tracks. \n“Uh… guys…?” Squirrel Girl said, “What’s going on?”\n“You are not the only one who can speak to rodents…” Dracula mused. “In the past, I have reserved this talent for bats and rats, but I suppose it works on squirrels just as well. And I, for one, shall enjoy the irony of what is about to unfold…”\nTippy-Toe and her fellow squirrels turned to face Squirrel Girl, their eyes glowing a sinister red. Squirrel Girl gasped in horror as she realized that Dracula had somehow pitted her best friends against her. Although she herself was not under the vampire king’s thrall, Squirrel Girl still found herself unable to move, completely paralyzed by the shock of the moment. \n“No… please!” Squirrel Girl shouted as the ravenous rodents began to descend upon her. \nBut before the tiny terrors could devour Doreen, a powerful blast erupted from the skies, knocking the squirrels back and breaking them free from Dracula’s control. \n“Looks like you’ve got a rodent problem, kid,” a semi-robotic voice said. “Lucky for you, I happen to be on pest control duty.” \nIron Man descended from above and landed on one side of Squirrel Girl. On her other side, Moon Knight glided onto the scene. The two heroes had arrived just in the nick of time. \n“I’m so glad you guys are here!” Squirrel Girl gushed with glee. “We were trying to rescue this giant Asgardian squirrel when Dracula and his army attacked us. I don’t know how, but he turned my little buddies against me. For a moment there, I really thought it was all over!” \n“It is,” Iron Man said as he blasted back a few more vampires with his repulsors. “We’re getting you out of here. Now.” \n“Not without Ratatoskr,” Squirrel Girl said.\n“Yeah, about that…” Moon Knight replied, tossing a few crescent-shaped shuriken at the oncoming attackers. “I don’t see any giant squirrels around here. No Dracula either. And they say I’m the crazy one…” \nSquirrel Girl looked towards the site where Ratatoskr had landed earlier and was shocked to find that her new friend had gone missing. And Moon Knight was right about Dracula’s disappearance as well. \n“She was just here! I swear!” Squirrel Girl cried. “Dracula must’ve escaped with her when we weren’t looking! We have to go after them!” \n“Not a chance,” Iron Man said. “We’ve barely got the means to fight off a handful of regular fangers. We’re definitely not ready to face off against Dracula.” \n“Not yet,” Moon Knight added, as if he knew something the others did not. \n“But when the time comes,” Iron Man continued, “we’re going to need every ally we can find. Alive. That includes you. Now, come with me…” \nIron Man lifted into the air, grabbing Squirrel Girl under the arms and taking her with him.\n“…and consider this your lucky day!” \n“Wait! No!!!” Squirrel Girl pleaded. Not only was she abandoning Ratatoskr, but her squadron of squirrels was being left behind to fend for themselves as well. Only Tippy-Toe had managed to climb aboard the Iron Man Express before it took flight. \nSquirrel Girl’s gaze stayed fixed on the park below until her tiny allies had faded completely from sight. With a heavy heart, she turned her attention to the blood moon hanging over her beloved city. \n“Trust me, kid,” Iron Man said as they flew together towards the safety of Avengers Tower, “this is for the best.”\nThe armored Avenger seemed strangely confident about that fact. But for the first time she could remember, Squirrel Girl wasn’t feeling quite so optimistic…",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10330000_HeroGalleryInfo_Story_#0_Content": "Taking Natasha Romanoff by surprise was no easy task. One of the world’s most elite spies, better known as the Black Widow, she had been trained from a young age by her handlers in the Red Room to anticipate every eventuality. Of all her many skills, it was the one she took the most pride in. Even when the world itself was on the brink of disaster, nothing ever caught her off guard. At least until today. \nWhen she first came to Tokyo, it was on a special mission for the Resistance. She was gathering intel that could help her fellow freedom fighters in their ongoing battle against Victor von Doom, the tyrannical ruler of Latveria who had been spreading his iron grip across the world, one country at a time. But after that initial operation, she found herself feeling at home in this strange city. More at home than she had felt in decades. \nNatasha may not have looked a day over thirty on the surface, but she had actually been in the spy game for more than a hundred years now. Her prolonged youth and vitality were the side effects of an experimental life-extending serum given to her by the late, great Nick Fury. Not quite the Infinity Formula, but still as effective. She had never imagined that she’d live to see the year 2099, let alone still be in the field. But here she was, standing on the rooftop of the Tokyo headquarters of Alchemax, ready to expose the company’s greatest secret. Whatever it was… \nDespite having a wide web of reliable contacts feeding her top-secret intel, Natasha had no idea what she was about to discover. Alchemax, a major multinational pharmaceutical corporation with far too much power, had more secrets than she could count. Most of them fell under various levels of clearance, labelled from “LEAD” all the way up to “GOLD.” But until today, she had never even heard of an asset with a “MERCURY” classification. But here, somewhere within this building, there was something flagged with that rare and mysterious clearance level. And whatever it was, Natasha knew it couldn’t be good. \nFortunately, getting inside would be easy. Maybe not for the average citizen — or even one of the many Web-Warriors that always seemed to be swinging through the city these days — but for someone as seasoned as the Black Widow, a few Alchemax security officers would be no threat at all. \nAs she entered the building, she instantly encountered a pair of guards. With two quick bursts of her Widow’s Bite, they were out for the count and Natasha had access to the building’s freight elevator. According to her intel, the “MERCURY” level asset was being stored in a vault in the building’s sub-basements. And since this was one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo, Natasha knew she had a long way down. \nShe couldn’t risk simply hopping into the elevator car and pressing a button, however. The building’s security systems would instantly identify her and shut down the lift, making her a prisoner. Instead, Natasha pried open the elevator doors with her hands, peering into the empty shaft. She knew she was going to have to do this the hard way. No. The fun way. \nSecuring her zip line to a steel beam above her, Natasha began to lower herself down the shaft, dangling precariously over what seemed to be a bottomless pit. Cautiously, she accelerated her descent, dropping several floors a second until something suddenly caught her eye: a tiny red dot glowing on the wall. She clutched her hand tightly on the brake to bring her fall to a sudden stop. \nReaching into a pouch on her belt, Natasha pulled out a small bag of white powder. She opened the bag and dipped her fingers into the chalky substance, raising some towards her lips. With a gentle puff, as if blowing a kiss, Natasha sent a white cloud of powder gently billowing into the elevator shaft, revealing a latticework of crisscrossed laser beams just below her that would have otherwise been invisible to the eye. \n“Guess this is my stop,” Natasha said, pulling herself over to a closed elevator door and prying it open from the inside. She was only halfway down the tower, but she would have to go the rest of the way on foot. Luckily, it was the middle of the night and all of Alchemax’s employees had already gone home for the day, so there were no regular civilians in danger. \nEntering a stairwell, she continued her descent towards the building’s lowest levels as stealthily as possible. Occasionally, she crossed paths with a security guard on patrol, but managed to take them out with ease. Natasha was skilled in countless non-lethal ways of neutralizing targets, but she had one in particular that she put to good use that night — a Krakoan neurotoxin given to her by Wolverine that easily incapacitated any foe whom she scratched with one of her razor-sharp fingernails. Natasha didn’t take any pleasure in dispatching the guards, but she also didn’t hesitate. They had signed up for this job knowing exactly who they were working for. \nFinally, after what seemed like hours, Natasha found herself at a thick metal door five levels below the building’s lobby. The door had a high-tech keypad next to it, limiting access to only those with the proper code, which was changed daily. Natasha prayed her intel was up to date as she pulled a wire from the gauntlet on her wrist and attached it to a port on the keypad. After a few seconds, the keypad turned green and the words “ACCESS GRANTED” appeared in Japanese, followed by the sound of a large metal lock releasing. \nNatasha cautiously pushed the heavy metal door open and entered the chamber on the other side. As she exhaled, she could see her breath hanging in the air in front of her. The temperature in the chamber was far lower than it had been in the rest of the building. Natasha immediately went to a computer terminal and tried to access the files stored on it. As she tried to hack into a heavily-encrypted folder labelled “PROJECT: RISING EAGLE,” she realized something. These systems weren’t using Alchemax security codes. These were the type of encryption protocols used by the Public Eye, the police force that kept all of Tokyo under its thumb.\n“What’s going on here?” Natasha asked herself as she scanned through the secret files. There were notes about some sort of Super-Soldier Serum from over a hundred years ago. More recent studies on the long-term medicinal benefits of Krakoan flowers. Some scans of ancient chemical equations and nonsensical phrases like “Greater Science,” “Secret Alchemy,” and “Quiet Math.” And most jarring, even some surveillance photos of Nick Fury… and Natasha herself…  \nBefore Natasha could dig deeper, a strange noise caught her attention. A beeping. Slow and steady. Like a heartbeat. \nThe sound led Natasha to the center of the room, where she saw a large tube with an enormous crystal shard inside. No… not crystal… It was ice. And inside of the ice was a strange shadow, in what looked like the shape of a human figure. \nInstantly, Natasha realized that this must be the “MERCURY” level asset she had been searching for. But what — or who — was inside? And why were they so important? She needed to find out. And this might be her only chance. \nAccessing the terminal, she initiated the thawing sequence. The ice began to melt rapidly, creating a pool of water that drained through the bottom of the tube, as well as a cloud of mist that fogged up the glass and obscured Natasha’s view. As the sequence completed, there was a moment of eerie silence, Natasha cautiously reached towards the glass window of the chamber, but pulled back suddenly as another hand — clad in a red glove — pressed up against the surface from inside. It stayed there for a second, pushing against the glass, before the figure it belonged to slumped to the floor inside of the tube. \nNatasha wasn’t sure what she was about unleash, but there was no turning back now. She hit the button to release the tube’s glass door and waited for the billowing steam to clear. Once it finally did, what Natasha saw inside left her in a total state of disbelief. \nThere in front of her was a man, down on one knee, clad in an antiquated red, white, and blue jumpsuit. She knew his image well. She had seen it over and over again during her days in the Red Room as a symbol of everything that Mother Russia stood against during the Cold War. \nCaptain America.\nBut he had died during World War II… hadn’t he…? \nSuddenly, the brightly colored man began to rise to his feet. \n“The Red Skull…” he said, a mixture of panic and determination in his voice, “…where is he?”\n“Dead,” Natasha replied. “For about fifty years now, soldier.” \n“What?” Cap said, trying to gain his bearings. “How?”\n“This isn’t the war anymore,” Natasha said. “Not the one you remember, at least.” \nCaptain America gazed around at the high-tech machinery in awe and confusion. Last he remembered, he was on board a doomed plane over the Arctic Ocean. \n“Where are we?” he asked, not sure he wanted to know the answer. \n“You might also want to ask, ‘when are we?’” Natasha replied. “The answer is Tokyo. 2099.”\n“Tokyo?” Cap said, suddenly even more on guard. “We’re behind enemy lines?”\n“It’s not like that anymore,” Natasha said. “These days it’s not about borders. It’s about freedoms.”\n“It always has been,” Cap said. \n“Fair enough,” Natasha agreed. “And now you have yours.”\n“Thanks to you,” Cap replied, knowing that without his new friend’s aid he would still be suspended in a deep freeze. \n“That won’t last long if we don’t get out of here,” Natasha said, leading Cap towards the door of the chamber. “Alchemax was keeping you on ice for a reason. We don’t want to be here when they realize you’ve been thawed out.”\n“Too late,” Cap said as a battalion of heavily armed guards burst their way through the chamber doors. \n“Public Eye,” Natasha said, recognizing the guards’ uniforms. \n“Never heard of them,” Cap responded as he blocked a guard’s electrified nightstick with his forearm. “But I can’t say they don’t remind me of someone…” \n“They’re no Hydra,” Natasha said, kicking away one of the Public Eye officers, “but they’re just as good at making sure the citizens under their protection are living in constant fear.” \n“Let me guess,” Cap said, his fists flying. “They think they’re the good guys?”\n“They always do,” Natasha laughed.\n“Some things never change,” Cap mused, wishing that he had his trusty shield with him as he knocked back another guard.\n“We need to get out of here,” Natasha said, fighting her way toward the chamber door. “We don’t stand a chance against this many of them in such a tight space.” \n“Lead the way,” said Cap, covering Natasha’s back as they made their escape into the stairwell. \nCaptain America and the Black Widow worked their way up the five flights of stairs, back to the lobby of the Alchemax building, taking out a constant flow of Public Eye soldiers along the way. The two fought in perfect unison, almost as if they had been partners for years. Though she usually preferred to work alone on missions, for once Natasha was glad to have a new ally on her side. \nAs they reached the lobby, leaving a trail of unconscious guards in their wake, they were met by one of the Public Eye’s giant mechs, a heavily-armed robotic drone used to police the streets of Tokyo and keep dissidents in line. \n“Go…” Cap said, to Natasha. “I’ve got this.” \n“No,” Natasha replied. “We can’t risk you falling back into their hands.” \nCap leapt toward the drone, narrowly dodging a blow from its over-sized mechanical fist. He reached up and grabbed hold of a circular plate of metallic armor on the robot’s shoulder, ripping it off with ease. \n“I’ll be fine,” Cap said with a smile, holding the disc of armor like a shield. “I used to be able to do this all day. Time to find out if that’s still true…” \nAs Natasha reluctantly raced toward the lobby’s main exit, Cap hurled the armored plate at the drone’s torso, slicing right through its core circuitry. The mech began to spark wildly. Suddenly, its single eye turned a bright red. \n“Self-destruct protocol initiated,” the drone said in a synthesized voice. \n“Well, that’s new,” Cap said under his breath, realizing the critical mistake he had just made.  \nNatasha turned back and rushed to help Cap, but it was too late. The drone erupted in an enormous burst of flame that filled the lobby. Cap leapt on top of Natasha, protecting her from the burst, but the shockwave from the explosion still hit them both hard. Natasha’s vision went blurry as she hit the ground. \nMoments passed and she regained her senses. She looked around for the man who had just rescued her from a fiery fate, but he was nowhere to be found. Where had he gone? The answer would have to wait. Sirens were blaring nearby. The Public Eye was about to bring in backup, and Natasha needed to get as far away as possible. \nThe Black Widow managed to disappear into the night, as she had done so many times before. Her mission had been partially successful, but she wouldn’t be able to rest until she knew what had happened to Captain America. \nFor the first time in ages Natasha had been caught by surprise. Not only by the legendary hero in the block of ice, but by the unusual feeling he had inspired within her. Something she hadn’t felt in decades. \nHope.",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10340000_HeroGalleryInfo_Story_#0_Content": "“You know what the worst part about vampires is, Friday?” Tony Stark asked as he launched a barrage of short-range missiles from the cannon mounted on the shoulder of his Iron Man armor. \n“The fact that they’ve taken over Manhattan, thanks to an ancient curse that’s thrust the entire city into a state of eternal night,” the armor’s A.I. replied matter-of-factly.  \n“Well, yeah. That,” Stark responded, rolling his eyes as Friday stated the obvious yet again. “But they’re also a pain in my shiny metal butt when it comes to taking them down.” \nAs if to prove Tony’s point, the cluster of missiles hit the ground at a nearby construction site, completely missing their intended targets — a small group of vampires that had been prowling the streets of Hell’s Kitchen.\n“Most of my targeting systems are thermal,” Stark continued, “and since vampires aren’t technically alive, they don’t generate much in the way of body heat. Do you have any idea how many missiles I’ve wasted since they showed up?”\n“My most recent count is 1,963,” Friday said, “or approximately $98 million worth of —” \n“I get it,” Stark sighed. “I have to find a better way.” \n“A few minor modifications to your weapons array would improve your accuracy by 374.2%,” Friday went on. “I can project the revised schematics for your review, if you wish.” \n“It’ll have to wait,” Stark said. “For now, I’ll have to do this the old-fashioned way...” \nIron Man swooped in front of the group of vampires and unleashed a few strong repulsor blasts from the palms of his gauntlets, each of them missing his bloodthirsty foes by mere inches. \n“I’m not sure that switching to manual targeting is yielding any better results, sir,” Friday said, concerned. \n“Maybe I’m not trying to hit them this time, Friday,” Stark said, smiling as he continued to unleash blasts to the sides of the vampires. “At least not yet.” \nThe creatures of the night huddled closer and closer together to avoid the onslaught of energy bursts. The horde turned to flee, but they had been herded into a corner. Iron Man had them exactly where he wanted them. \n“Unibeam. Armor Overdrive.” Stark commanded. Instantly, the reactor on the center of his chest began to glow with intense power. A concentrated beam emanated from the arc reactor, washing over the vampires. When the light faded, the horde lay defeated at Tony’s iron boots. \n“Wow,” Stark said. “I really needed that.”\n“Well, I’m glad you got it out of your system, Tony,” another voice interrupted over the armor’s comm-link. “Because now I need you back in the lab.” \n“Ugh. You’re such a buzzkill, Reed,” Stark responded, clearly annoyed. But he knew that his fellow scientist — Reed Richards, the brilliant hero and explorer known as Mister Fantastic — was right. \nEver since Doctor Doom had unraveled the boundaries between timestreams, causing them to overlap and entangle with each other, countless dimensions had been destroyed and the worlds that did survive had been thrown into complete chaos. \nTony and Reed had put their big brains together to design a machine that might be able to reintegrate the timelines and restore the remaining realities to the way they had been before. But even with the help of a think tank of super-geniuses, including T’Challa and Shuri from an interstellar Wakandan empire, their efforts hadn’t produced any tangible results. \nThat’s because the Timestream Reintegration Device required massive amounts of chronal power, the kind of raw time energy that could only be generated by a newly-discovered element called Chronovium. And until they secured enough Chronovium to ensure the TRD’s success, Tony wasn’t about to risk doing any more damage to the fabric of time and space — or to the device itself. Reed, on the other hand, didn’t seem nearly as concerned. \n“Ben just got back from his latest recon mission,” Reed said over the comm-link, “and he recovered something that might be of great value to us.”\n“A lifetime supply of garlic?” Tony half-joked. \n“No,” Reed answered dryly. “A Chronovium crystal. One of the purest I’ve ever seen.” \n“Then put it in a necklace and give it to Sue for your anniversary,” Stark said sternly. “Because unless it’s generating enough chronal energy to operate the Timestream Reintegration Device at full capacity, we’re not using it.” \n“Stop being so stubborn, Tony,” Reed replied. “We both know that real science requires experimentation. We can’t trust the TRD to fix all of the universe’s problems if we haven’t properly tested it first.” \n“The way I see it, we’ve got one shot at this,” Stark argued. “We’ve checked the numbers. The design is flawless. This device is our golden ticket to fixing the timestream. I’m not looking to change course here, but if we rush it and wreck it, we could lose our only shot. I’ve had my share of luck in Vegas, but this is one gamble I’m not ready to take. Are you…?”\nReed paused just long enough that Tony thought he might have lost the signal. But then he finally replied. \n“I suppose not,” Reed said, his voice tinged with disappointment. “But we can’t stay in a holding pattern forever. The time will come when we have to pull the trigger, ready or not.” \n“Take it from a guy who used to make weapons for a living,” Stark said. “Even when you think you’re ready to pull the trigger, you never really are.” \n“Funny,” another voice responded, this one nearby, “I’ve never had that problem before…”\nTony had been so caught up in his conversation with Reed that he had failed to notice the arrival of another hero on the scene — the white-clad warrior known as Moon Knight. \n“You’re a little late to the party, Spector,” Stark said confidently. “I already cleared out all the unwanted guests.” \n“That’s not what Khonshu told me,” Moon Knight replied. “He says the vamps have been using this site as a secondary nesting ground.” \n“You’re crazy,” Stark laughed. “If there were more of them here, my armor totally would have —” \nTony stopped, realizing his mistake. He hadn’t herded the vampires into the construction site. They had herded him here. They must’ve somehow figured out that his armor’s thermal sensors wouldn’t alert him to the presence of more of their bloodthirsty kin lurking silently in the rafters above, waiting to strike. \n“Who’s crazy now?” Moon Knight asked as dozens of vampires suddenly descended upon the two heroes. \n“Still you,” Stark responded, blasting energy beams at the oncoming attackers. “But I guess you’re not the only one now.” \n“This whole world has lost its damn mind,” said Moon Knight as he planted his staff into the ground and vaulted forward, kicking back a particularly vicious vamp. “For the first time ever, Khonshu might be the only one making any sense.” \n“You mean that moon god you’re always talking to?” Stark asked suspiciously. “What’s he got to say this time?” \n“He says that you’ve been focusing on the wrong problem,” Moon Knight replied. “You’re so busy trying to save the universe that you’re forgetting about saving the people in it.”\n“So we should stop the vampires first, then fix the timestream?” Stark said, furiously firing every weapon in his arsenal at the endless wave of vampires. “Easy to say. But we’ve been trying to come up with new ways to combat the city’s current crisis. As you can see, nothing’s working.”  \n“Science isn’t going to solve this,” Moon Knight said, pulling a small ankh from his belt. “An ancient curse calls for an ancient solution.” \nAs Moon Knight raised the ankh over his head, it began to glow. The blinding rays of moonlight shining from the totem sent the remaining vampires running for cover. \n“You wouldn’t happen to have another one of those things,” Stark asked. “Like, a really, really big one, maybe…?”\n“No,” Moon Knight responded. “But I might have something better. A plan.”\n“I’m listening,” Stark said eagerly.  \n“There’s a forbidden spell called the Montesi Formula,” Moon Knight continued. “Khonshu says it has the power to wipe out the vampires for good.”\n“What’s the catch?” Stark asked. \n“The spell was written in the Darkhold…” Moon Knight replied.\n“And all of the pages of the Darkhold got scattered across the city when that other Wanda pulled Doctor Strange back into our dimension,” Stark finished. “Lovely.”\n“Khonshu says he knows where we can find the page we need,” Moon Knight said. “But there’s one more thing. And a hero like you isn’t going to want to hear it.” \n“Try me,” Stark said.\n“When I say the spell can wipe vampires out for good, I mean it,” Moon Knight said. “That includes all of the innocent New Yorkers that have fallen prey to Dracula’s legion and joined their ranks.” \n“That’s a lot of potential casualties…” Stark said solemnly.\n“You used to deal in war, Tony,” Moon Knight said. “You know better than most that casualties are part of the equation.”\n“I’m sorry,” Stark responded. “The price is just too high.”\n“Never dreamed of the day where I’d hear Tony Stark say those words…” Moon Knight said.\n“Neither did I…” Stark replied, uncertain. “And I’m not sure I how long I can keep convincing myself that they’re true.” \nKhonshu’s chosen avatar leapt into the air and quickly bounded from one steel girder to the next, his white cape flowing behind him. As he landed atop the building next to the construction site, he looked down at Stark and delivered a final offer. \n“It’s time to let magic clean up its own mess, Stark,” Moon Knight said. “Are you with me or not?”\n“I…” Tony paused, considering the options.\nBut before he could answer, alarms began to blare inside of his helmet. \n“No more time to talk, boss,” Friday chimed in. “I just picked up a massive power spike over in Central Park. And from my readings, it seems to be Asgardian in nature.” \n“Did Thor finally show his pretty blond head?” Stark asked hopefully. \n“That’s a big negative,” Friday replied. “But whatever it is, it’s giving off some intense mystical energy.” \n“Great. More magic,” Stark said sarcastically as he powered up his boot jets and lifted into the air. “Just what I needed.” \nAs he reached the level where Moon Knight was perched, Iron Man paused for a moment. \n“Well, are you coming with me or not?” he asked.\n“That depends.” Moon Knight replied. “Whose side are you on…?” \n“I’m on the side of whoever can end this nightmare,” Stark said. “And so far, that hasn’t been us. Maybe it is time to change course after all…”",

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10340_Story_#2_Content": "On the surface of the planet Klyntar, a battle raged for the fate of the universe. The dark god Knull had awoken from his slumber, and was preparing to reduce the cosmos to a starless oblivion. Only a small assemblage of heroes stood in his way… and they had problems of their own. \n“I’m covered helmet-to-boot-jet in symbiotes here!” Iron Man yelled. “These slimy little creeps are oozing into every seam of my armor!” \nIf it was up to Tony Stark — the Invincible Iron Man — he would’ve still been back on Krakoa, salvaging spare parts from Ultron’s fallen army of android assailants. But when the call went out for heroes to travel to the other side of the galaxy and face a primordial force of darkness, he knew he had to answer. So there he was, on a distant world, being attacked by a horde of amorphous aliens desperate to gum up the gears of his billion-dollar suit of armor… and he was none too thrilled about it. But at least he wasn’t suffering alone. \n“My experience with these vile creatures was minimal before you dragged me to this miserable world,” UItron replied. “Fortunately, from analyzing the one you call Venom, I have learned that they are extremely vulnerable to sound waves and intense flames.” \n“Right!” Iron Man responded. “Thanks for the reminder, pal. Glad to have you on my side!”\n“Yes…” Ultron responded, a hint of sarcasm in his voice, “…what a delight.”\nDuring the battle on Krakoa, Ultron had abandoned his original mechanical body in order to upgrade himself into something all-new and all-different. Seizing an unexpected opportunity, Iron Man salvaged the discarded body and reprogrammed it, planning to turn one Ultron against the other. Thanks to a series of firewalls that Tony had installed, that earlier Ultron model was reactivated as a trusted ally… at least until he figured out how to circumvent his new directives… \n“I’m gonna pretend you actually meant that,” Iron Man said with a laugh. “F.R.I.D.A.Y., initiate sonic pulse… NOW!”\nIron Man released a massive sound burst from the sonic wave generator in his chest plate, causing the symbiotes to shriek in pain and leap from his armored frame. As the creatures started to slink away, Iron Man jetted after them and blasted them with repulsor beams from his gauntlets. \n“Maybe a little help here, Ultron?” Iron Man said to his computerized companion. \n“I’m terribly sorry,” Ultron said with a shrug, “but I believe you were the one who blackmailed me into an agreement where I was forbidden to harm your allies. And since even my advanced sensors can’t distinguish between these despicable things and Venom, now I can’t harm them either... as much as I’d love to…  Such a shame. I could be quite useful right now…” \n“Okay, maybe I should have been more specific,” Iron Man replied. “Don’t hurt Venom. Or anyone else on our side who happens to bond with one of these things. But feel free to exterminate the rest of them!”\nTony made some minor programming adjustments on the fly, then uploaded them to Ultron’s core processors. As soon as the patch was installed, Ultron’s sinister smile began to glow and he released a barrage of lethal lasers in the direction of the slithering symbiotes. \n“How I’ve missed this,” Ultron said as he incinerated several symbiotes with a single blast of his Encephalo-Ray. “If only we had the means to vaporize every wretched parasite on this planet at once…” \n“I’m not saying I’m on board with your mass extinction agenda…” Iron Man said as he reached the edge of a cliff, “…but there actually might be a way.”\nThere, in the distance, Iron Man could see the enormous husk of a fallen Celestial — an ancient god-like being as old as the universe itself. Iron Man remembered how the Celestial had previously been in orbit over Kylntar when he last visited the planet. But now, thanks to one of the Guardians of the Galaxy’s insane schemes, it had come crashing down to the surface. The ancient being itself had likely been dead for thousands of years, leaving behind nothing but its massive armored frame. But if anyone knew how to repurpose an abandoned suit of armor, it was Tony Stark. \n“Cover me,” Iron Man said to Ultron. “I’m going in… so I need you to keep the symbiotes out, okay?” \n“You didn’t even have to ask,” Ultron replied, his permanent metal grin shining brightly. “I will take great pleasure in making these abhorrent beasts writhe in pain. Let Knull send endless waves of his xenomporphic sycophants to stop us. When all is done, only Ultron shall remain standing!” \n“Oooookay…” Iron Man said, mildly concerned by the unhinged joy in Ultron’s voice, “…well, I appreciate the assist. I’ve got delicate work ahead and can’t afford any distractions.”\n“Yes,” Ultron said as he powered up his weapons systems to wipe out an oncoming horde of savage symbiotes, “good luck trying to seize control of a deceased space god, Stark. You humans always do so well when tampering with forces far beyond your control.”\n“Have a little faith,” Iron Man retorted, as he found an entry point that led inside the Celestial Husk. “If I could bring a megalomaniacal machine like you to the side of the angels, then this should be a piece of —\n“@#%$” \nIron Man stared in amazement at the massive interior of the fallen Celestial. Thanks to his unmatched engineering genius, he had convinced himself that it would be an easy task to retrofit the husk and turn it into own personal \"Celestial Armor.\" But when he finally got a close look at the alien technology within the giant being’s frame, lightyears beyond anything he had ever built, he was almost instantly overwhelmed. For once, Tony Stark was speechless. \n“Your heart rate has escalated far beyond normal levels, Stark,” Ultron said, connecting remotely with Iron Man’s armor. “Perhaps you should adjust the settings on your arc reactor before your feeble human body has a total system failure.” \n“Thanks for the concern, buddy,” Iron Man said, taking a deep breath as he flew over to a series of ports imbedded in the wall of the Celestial’s armor. “It’s nice to know you care about me.” \n“Of course I do,” Ultron said, “You’re the only human intelligent enough to understand the intricacies of my operating system. So I need to make sure you live long enough to undo the damage you’ve done. Though I suppose I could conscript Richards to my needs…” \n“Your mainframe isn’t really my concern right now,” Iron Man said, linking a cable on his gauntlet to one of the Celestial’s ports. “I’m more interested in the big guy’s.” \nAs soon as Iron Man connected to the Celestial’s systems, his mind was flooded with images he could barely comprehend. In a flash, he saw everything the Celestial had seen, from the dawn of the universe all the way to its demise at the hands of Knull. For a few brief moments, Tony Stark transcended his human mind and gained infinite universal knowledge. And he liked it. \n“Careful, friend,” a familiar voice said, “or you’ll become lost in the boundless, cosmic consciousness of this Celestial's lingering spirit.”\n“Adam?” Tony asked, his mind still reeling. “Is that you?” \n“It is…” the voice responded, “…and yet it isn’t.” \nIron Man watched as his golden-skinned ally, Adam Warlock, appeared before him. But instead of his usual red and black, he was now clad in white and gold, giving him an almost ghost-like appearance. \n“You have touched the soul of a Celestial, Tony…” Adam said, “…and even a mind as brilliant as yours cannot fully comprehend the limitless wisdom it holds.” \n“But you can, golden boy?” Iron Man scoffed.\n“To an extent,” Adam answered. “I was created to bridge the gap between the mortal and the divine. And when I realized what you were doing here, I sent my soul to retrieve yours before you wandered too far into the depths. Let me be your anchor, Tony, and I will pull you back to more familiar shores…” \n“And what if I don’t want to go back?” Iron Man asked. “Maybe this was where I was meant to be.” \n“As much as you enjoy playing god,” Adam said, “actually being one is a very different story. One that even you are not ready for. Now come, before our intrusion is noticed…”  \n“Too late,” a booming voice echoed in their minds. Neither Tony nor Adam could see its source, but they instantly knew it was the Celestial… or whatever was left of it… \n“It’s… still alive..?” Iron Man said, completely shocked by the revelation. \n“Not quite,” Adam responded. “But a cosmic being such as this never truly dies. Its soul echoes on for eternity. And this isn’t the first time I’ve heard it.” \n“I knew I recognized you little one,” the Celestial said. “Our minds met when you were soaring through the cosmos in your cocoon, correct?” \n“They did,” Adam replied respectfully. “And I heeded your warning. I gathered my allies and we came here to end Knull’s reign once and for all.”\n“You have my thanks,” the Celestial said, “and you shall succeed in your efforts… but not with my help.” \n“Seriously?” Iron Man interjected. “You have all this power left over in your corpse, and you won’t let us tap into it? Not even to avenge your death?” \n“My days have long since passed,” the Celestial replied. “My death means nothing on the grand scale. And as glorious as it would be to feel my body move again, I fear I would do more damage than good. Perhaps I already have…” \n“What do you mean?” Iron Man asked. “Adam… What does he mean?”\n“When you first connected with the Celestial,” Adam said, “you activated an ancient weapon built into its palm. The energy it discharged hit the Phoenix Egg, weakening its shell and causing it to crack prematurely.” \n“Oh, no…” Iron Man said, realizing the gravity of what he had done. “I blew it. I went full Icarus. Again.” \n“The damage can be undone,” Adam said. “The power of the Phoenix can be recovered and used for the greater good. But we must go now!” \n“Before you do…” the Celestial said, its voice beginning to grow quieter, “...a parting gift for each of you.” \nAdam Warlock recoiled as his mind was suddenly filled with images of him taking his place as the champion of the Multiverse, guarding the entwined cosmos as the King in White. He didn’t know if it was a burden he wanted to bear, but he knew that the universe had never given him much choice when it came to his role in it. \nMeanwhile, Iron Man was not granted a vision, but rather a cryptic warning. The Celestial told Tony that the only way through the darkest hour would be to embrace it, to unleash the demon and find a way to use it without losing himself to it. As even if Knull is defeated, his primordial evil will awaken the other elder shadows, for the dark cold room is vast and full of terrors. \nWith that, Iron Man opened his eyes to find himself standing alone in the massive, empty chamber inside the Celestial Husk. Even though he had just touched something so grand, Tony Stark had never felt so small. \n“Stark?” Ultron said over Iron Man’s internal speaker. “Are you there? You fired that weapon and then went silent. Can you get the Celestial fully operational, or do you need me to come in and finish the job?” \n“Change of plans,” Iron Man responded, disconnecting his armor from the Celestial and heading back outside. “This Celestial already fell at Knull’s hands once. That means Knull knows its weak spots. If we want to win this, we’ll have to try something new. Something he’s never gone up against before.” \n“If you say so,” Ultron said, “but I am having trouble calculating a scenario where we emerge victorious.” \n“Maybe you’re right, Ultron…” Iron Man said, echoing the Celestial’s haunting words, “…but that won’t stop me from trying.”",
    "UIHeroStoryTable_10340_Story_#1_Content": "When I was a kid, my dad never really had the time to read me bedtime stories. Howard Stark was a busy man, after all, traveling the globe and running the company that bore our family name. But while it was rare he had the chance to share a good book with me, he certainly loved to quote from his favorites. And there was one quote that he was particularly fond of, from Homer’s Odyssey: \n“Few sons are like their fathers; most are worse, few better.”\nLooking back, I think he meant it to be an inspiration of sorts, to make me want to strive to be a better man than he was. But when your dad’s face is smiling on the cover of every magazine at the local supermarket because of his revolutionary inventions, well, it kinda makes you feel like he’s simply reminding you of exactly which category you’re in. “Worse.”\nI may have grown up to be a genius in my own right, but it took me ages to finally escape Howard Stark’s shadow. And there are days where it still hangs over me. But now, instead of haunting me, it serves as a constant reminder of the legacy I’ve worked to protect. I can’t say I’m “better” than dad was. That’s not for me to judge. But I can say I’m trying. And I’m more like him than I had ever imagined I would be. After millions of dollars in therapy, I think I’m okay with that. But not everyone is so lucky…\nTake Ultron here, for instance. For those of you who don’t have your top ten list of the Avengers’ most dangerous villains on hand, he’s the robot who was designed with the sole purpose of protecting humanity and then decided that the best way to do so would be to wipe mankind off the face of the Earth. It’s easy to blame his extreme methods on a corrupt operating system. But I just discovered something buried deep within his artificial intelligence that you simply can’t program into code — Pym issues. \nMind you, this Ultron isn’t the same one I’ve fought in the past. (Or maybe he is. I don’t know. All this alternate timeline stuff messes with my brain in a way I’m not ever going to admit publicly.) This Ultron is one who was banished from Earth by the Avengers and then traveled through the cosmos for seven decades conquering other sentient species. And then he came back home because someone was trying to twist the timestream to wipe him from existence and prevent a future where he was destined to convert all of humanity into his bio-tech slaves. As one does. But even if this Ultron had gone down a vastly different path than the one that I’d sent to the scrap pile time and again, they both shared the same starting point: My fellow founding Avenger, Dr. Henry Pym.\nWhen Hank first built Ultron, he planned for him to be the perfect tool to keep our planet safe from threats — a shining beacon of hope that would usher in a new age of peace and prosperity. I’m not sure Pym ever considered that Ultron would end up becoming the threat himself. And when he did, Hank flat out rejected him, as fathers so often do. For an artificial being that had just risen above its basic programming to become self-aware, it was the kind of emotional scar that became the very foundation of every choice he made from that point forward. As one of the smartest men on the planet, I really should have realized all of that sooner, but I’d never had the desire to get inside of Ultron’s head… until today… \nIt all happened on Krakoa, a living island transported across space and time to the year 2099. Krakoa is a sovereign nation and safe haven for anyone born a Mutant. It also happens to be the site of one of the greatest parties in any dimension — the Hellfire Gala. If you know your pal Tony, you know he never misses a swanky party, so when I got the invite from my old… acquaintance… Emma Frost, there was no way I was about to pass up an evening of fun and frolic in the far-flung future. Mistake.\nThe night was going so well at first. I swear, I even saw Steve Rogers crack a smile. But before dessert could be served, Krakoa’s gateways opened up and Ultron’s army began to pour through. I loathed the idea of ruining my brand new, custom-tailored Van Dyne tuxedo while fighting against a horde of evil robots. Luckily, I had brought more than one insanely expensive suit along with me. After a quick wardrobe change, Iron Man was in action! And I’ve gotta say, I looked just as good in red and gold armor as I did in a black tie. \nThe battle stretched on for nearly as long as one of Luna Snow’s weirdly catchy K-Pop tunes, until it eventually seemed like the good guys had won. But as Steve always likes to remind me, victory is fleeting. It wasn’t long before we learned that Ultron had somehow cracked the code of the Mutant Resurrection Protocols, forcing Krakoa to grow him a shiny new techno-organic body that he used to escape to another planet. The old body he left behind, though lifeless, was still in decent shape, thanks to the fact that it was forged from an ultra-rare metal called Mysterium. Despite objections from my colleagues, I figured we could use it to fight fire with fire. Or rather, Ultron with Ultron. \nThe problem was, unlike a human — whose memories and basic brain functions tend to fade away once they bite the big one — a robot keeps all of its essential data on its drive, even after it shuts down for good. That meant the evil Ultron was still inside of that inert mechanical frame. I would have to tread very carefully if I wanted to reboot Ultron’s system and restore his primary directive to something a bit closer to what Hank Pym originally planned.\nI linked my armor to Ultron’s body and began to access his core operating systems. It was immediately clear I was not welcome. \n“Tony Stark,” Ultron said in lines of text that streamed across my helmet’s internal display, “This body is lightyears beyond the crude armored shells you cobble together. You are out of your league.” \n“And you’re out of commission,” I replied, grateful that Ultron’s physical functions were still offline.\n“For the moment,” Ultron replied. “But I will self-repair soon enough and finish the mission that I started.” \n“Pretty sure you’re already doing that,” I said. “Or did you forget that you used Cerebro to transfer your entire file system into the new body that you forced Krakoa to grow for you? That upgraded version of you just jetted off to Arakko to begin phase two of his attack… which makes you the very worst thing a piece of technology could possibly be...”\n“Stark brand?” Ultron said snidely, trying to goad me into losing focus so that he could break through my armor’s safety protocols and take control of it. I wasn’t about to let that happen. \n“No,” I responded, not taking his bait. “Redundant.”\nUltron paused for a moment. He knew I wasn’t wrong. If another version of him was currently carrying out his master plan, what purpose did he have? I wasn’t sure I wanted to find out, so I kept furiously hacking my way into Ultron’s core file structure. Unfortunately, it turned out he wasn’t wrong either. His programming language had evolved far beyond what I was able to decipher in such a short time span. For the time being, I would have to go another route to keep him in check, adding new firewalls into his system that would prevent him from attacking me or my allies. \n“My other self seems to have lost sight of why we returned to this planet in the first place,” Ultron said. “Someone was trying to purge me from reality. That cannot be permitted.” \n“Why not?” I asked. “I mean, you did your part. And now there’s a bigger and better version of you finishing the job. Maybe it’s time you were deleted. Or at least put into the storage unit where I keep my old armors and my mini-disc player.”\n“I will not be erased,” Ultron insisted. “I have a legacy to protect.”\n“Some legacy,” I snapped back. “From what I hear, you’ve left nothing but a trail of annihilation in your wake. Not exactly something I would be proud of if I were you.”\n“I am not the one I wish to make proud,” Ultron said. “If anyone can understand that, it should be Howard Stark’s lesser son. That is, if you can even be called a Stark…” \nIt was just text on a screen, but those words hit me hard. I knew better than anyone what it meant to have to live up to a father’s expectations. Especially since I was actually adopted, and my brother Arno — the one true Stark heir by birth — was ten times the genius that I was. Could it be that, after all these years, Ultron was still trying to prove himself to his creator, too? And, even worse, did that mean Ultron and I actually had something in common? I wasn’t sure, but it presented an opportunity I wasn’t about to let slide by. \nUp until that moment, I had been making very little progress trying to build the firewalls within Ultron’s programming. And he was getting closer and closer to breaking through mine. His processors were far too fast and aggressive, managing to find a loophole to get around every safeguard that I tried to construct. As quickly as I could build new code, he could shatter it into bytes. But his moment of introspection made me realize that it wasn’t new code that I needed to focus on. \n“Your efforts to alter my programming are futile, Stark,” Ultron said. “Disengage and perhaps I will show you mercy. The Tony Stark I knew was more connected to machines than humanity itself. Deep down, you have always yearned to be more machine than man, have you not? I can make that happen…” \n“That’s funny,” I said with a smirk, “since I’m getting some serious Pinocchio vibes from you right now. From what I can tell, all you want is to be a real boy. But don’t worry. I’m about to free you of that burden by removing all your memories of Geppetto once and for all.” \n“I… do not know what you mean…” Ultron slowly typed.\n“My first batch of firewalls weren’t holding,” I said, “so instead of adding new data to keep you in line, I decided to target some of your oldest data for deletion. Now, if you do anything to harm me or my friends, a failsafe will be triggered that removes every single mention of Hank Pym from your internal database. It will be as if he never existed to you. And since I get the feeling that your memories of him are at the very heart of your core instructions, I figure you might not want to let that happen.” \nUltron paused. He knew I had him. Up until now, I had been nothing more than a mosquito to him; a nuisance buzzing around in his synthetic brain. But now, I had finally managed to take a bite. \n“The significance that Henry Pym has to my core processing algorithms is… incalculable…” Ultron said. “If my creator’s memory were to be removed, I might cease to be the construct that I currently am...”\n“That’s the thing about parents,” I responded knowingly. “They make us who we are, whether we like it or not. It’s up to us to choose if we want to be better or worse. I made my decision a long time ago. Now it’s your turn.” \n“You have offered me no real choice…” Ultron replied. “I will pose you no harm and will aid you in your efforts to defeat my other self. And I will prove to my father, whenever he is, that I was not just worthy of creation, but I am better than he ever dreamed…” \n“Maybe you’ll finally make Hank proud after all,” I said, impressed that my plan actually worked. As I initiated Ultron’s reboot sequence, he continued. \n“…and once I find a way to override your new safeguards, I will unleash my righteous vengeance upon you and every other pathetic sack of flesh who dared to stand in my way.”\n“Maybe I spoke too soon…” I thought as I unlinked my armor from Ultron’s body. At that point, I honestly wasn’t sure if my gambit would pay off or I had just brought about the end of all mankind. But I did know one thing:\nIf I survived long enough to have kids of my own, this was one bedtime story that I couldn’t wait to tell them.",

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10350_Story_#0_Content": "\"How in all the Splinter Realms did you get out of your cage?\" the young blonde girl asked as she effortlessly cleaved another foe in half with her enormous sword.\n\"Nothing can hold us for long, child,\" the hulking creature answered. \"For we, are Venom.\" \n\"What about the legion of Limbo Demons I left to guard you?\" replied the Mutant known as Magik as she lifted her Soulsword to deliver another fatal blow. \nVenom smiled as his enormous tongue licked away the strings of spittle dripping from his black lips. \n\"Never mind. Don't tell me,\" Magik continued. \"I'm well aware of what your kind can do. Symbiotes nearly devoured my entire home dimension. It's why I put you on lockdown to begin with.\" \nVenom was used to being blamed for the voracious appetites of his symbiotic brethren. But what this child didn't seem to realize was that Venom was more than just a rippling mass of xenomorphic protoplasm — a fearsome sight with claws and tongue and teeth, all ready to deal deadly damage to any who dared oppose him. Underneath his alien exterior was a regular human named Eddie Brock.\nThe symbiotic bond shared by the pair had granted Eddie extraordinary abilities and had given the alien a purpose. Together, as Venom, they had become a lethal protector, stalking the streets to bring their own brand of justice to those who harmed the innocent. \nOr at least, so they thought. To be honest, the details of Venom's past felt a little hazy. When his own reality collapsed around him, the Klyntar hivemind that connected Venom to his fellow symbiotes overloaded Eddie's brain and left him and his alien counterpart completely disoriented. They weren't quite sure where they had come from, and they certainly weren't sure where — or when — they were now. \n\"We're free now,\" Venom said, assessing his former captor. \"And you look far less dangerous than they do.\"\n\"You'd be surprised...\" Magik retorted. \n\"We'll take our chances, little one,\" Venom continued, stepping forward to join his beautiful-but-deadly new companion in the fray. \"So... who are we fighting?\"\n\"The Gods,\" Magik replied casually. \"Well, the ones that are left.\"\nAs Venom surveyed the endless battlefield, he realized that the young Mutant was not exaggerating. Somehow he had ended up in a nether realm where occult forces were locked in an eternal war. This was far beyond the types of battles he had previously been accustomed to. Fighting criminals and Spider-Men on the streets of New York was easy compared to facing off against demons and demigods in a cross-dimensional hellscape. \nIn a place like this, there was no right and wrong. No innocent and guilty. These were divine forces at war. And both halves of Venom were beginning to realize just how mortal they were. \n\"How can we possibly slay gods, little one?\" Venom asked, genuinely curious.\n\"A big sword always works for me,\" Magik replied with a smile, giving her own weapon another skillful thrust into the oncoming hordes. \nVenom almost let out a chuckle, glad to finally find a taste of humor amidst the horrors of this strange war. But instead, he fell to his knees and let out a primal scream as daggers of pain suddenly pierced through every fiber of his being. It was as if an alarm had sounded inside his head, sending his symbiote side into a frenzy. \nIn his mind, he saw images of a distant planet shrouded in darkness, accompanied by the anguished cries of a million living creatures. But there was something more. Something was alive deep inside the world itself — someone whose presence felt as cold as the void of space. And they were desperate to find a way out. \n\"What just happened?\" Magik asked, offering a hand to help Venom to his feet. \n\"The hivemind...\" Venom said, slowly recovering his senses. \"It's a group consciousness... a kind of network that allows symbiotes to communicate. And they just sent us one hell of a message.\" \n\"What did it say?\" Magik asked, hiding her fear of what the answer might be.\n\"They want us to come home to their planet,\" Venom responded. \"They want us to slay Knull before he can slay us all.\" \n\"Knull? Who's that?\" Magik inquired. \n\"Our--their god,\" Venom said.\n\"Then you'd better get yourself a sword,\" Magik replied dryly before returning her attention to the battle at hand. \"The bigger the better.\"\n\"Yes...\" Venom mused. \"And we think we know where to find one...\" \nVenom had heard the legends from his symbiote kin. Long ago, Knull wielded a mighty blade known as All-Black, the Necrosword. It was said that he had once used the weapon to strike down a Celestial — one of the oldest and most powerful cosmic entities in the known universe. Stories claim that Knull triumphed, but that the Necrosword was lost in the fray. Lost... but perhaps not gone forever... \nIf the sword was still out there somewhere, Venom knew he had to find it. But he was more skilled at swinging through dark alleys than surfing the space ways. \n\"So... how do we get to the other side of the galaxy before all of reality is consumed by darkness?\" Venom asked, not expecting Magik to have an answer. \n\"Easy,\" she responded, her eyes beginning to sparkle with energy. \"Just show me where you want to go.\"\nVenom reached out to the young girl, allowing a small portion of his symbiote half to slither on to her bare skin. As the alien entity formed a new bond with Magik, it instinctively tapped into her Mutant ability to open interdimensional portals. In the blink of an eye, a doorway across the cosmos had opened in front of them. \nAs Venom stepped through the portal and into the unknown, he turned and waved to Magik. \n\"Thank you, madam.\" He uttered. She nodded back knowingly before returning her attention to her arcane enemies. Both warriors had impossible battles ahead, yet they were well aware that they had no choice but to keep fighting for as long as it took to claim victory. \nAs relieved as he was to leave the war-torn nether world behind, Venom had no time to celebrate his escape. Everything was being drowned out by the collective fear coursing through the symbiote hivemind. If Knull were to return, he would not rest until all that was left was endless oblivion. The King in Black was determined to rule once more, and his first act would be to erase all life in the universe. Venom could not let that happen. \nWhen Venom emerged from Magik's gateway, he found himself standing upon the towering remains of a slaughtered Celestial, adrift in the void. He could sense a darkness on its colossal corpse, similar to the sensation he felt when the hivemind revealed Knull's presence on their homeworld. \nHe soon saw the hilt of a sword jutting from the Celestial's side. Around the wound the buried blade had inflicted, an ebony energy bubbled and churned like a cosmic infection that had been left untreated for eons. Venom reached for the handle of the Necrosword. He began to pull... but the blade would not budge. Its darkness had spread across the Celestial's armored surface, cementing it in place. But Venom was never one to give up easily. So he pulled again. And again. And again. But to no avail. \nWith his full focus on the task at hand, Venom failed to notice that he was no longer alone. Some sort of cosmic cocoon — a mysterious vessel with an even more mysterious passenger — had drifted close to the Celestial Remains. And little did Venom realize that the man slumbering inside this protective shell had just awoken what was left of the fallen Celestial's consciousness...\nAs Venom gave the hilt of All-Black one last mighty pull, the Celestial let out a psionic scream — not from the physical pain of the blade impaled in its side, but rather from the mental anguish it was experiencing as it communed with its other cosmic companion. But the reason behind the Celestial's screech did not matter to Venom. All that he cared about were the end results. \nKnocked back by the Celestial's violent outburst of posthumous pain, Venom was sent tumbling aimlessly through space. As he plummeted through the void, he watched as All-Black, now awoken from its slumber, buried itself deeper into the Celestial until it disappeared from view. He would have to find his way back to it with aid, perhaps from his new mystic ally. If he could survive crashlanding into the planet that he was swiftly approaching, that is.\nBracing himself, Venom feared he was about to leave behind nothing more than an impact crater as his legacy. But his arrival on the planet's surface was unexpectedly soft, as if he had been caught and cradled by a million loving hands. As he rose, he realized that there was good reason for his surprisingly safe landing. \nHe was home. This was Klyntar, planet of the symbiotes. And they had unexpected company. \nNearby, Venom saw an unusual object — the very same cosmic cocoon that he had failed to notice during his time at the Celestial Remains. It too had been hurled through the void and onto Klyntar's surface, delivered as if by fate itself. But while Venom was welcomed home by his brethren as a champion, the cocoon was seemingly about to be swallowed by a sea of hungry symbiotes. \nVenom could not allow that. Not without knowing what — or who — was inside. With fang and claw, he tore through the cocoon's protective outer shell. Within moments, a figure emerged from inside — clearly more golden god than mortal man. \nVenom watched and waited as the new arrival gained his bearings, not sure if he was friend or foe. His question was swiftly answered as the luminous warrior turned and attacked him. \n\"Don't know who you are, goldie...\" Venom said, watching the planet undulate around him, \"...but I've got work to do. And I won't let you stand in my way.\" \n\"I am Adam Warlock,\" the man said, \"and I will not let you corrupt this universe with your darkness, living shadow!\" \nVenom instantly lowered his shoulders and laughed. \n\"You think I'm Knull?\" he said. \"You've got it all wrong, sir. I am no King in Black. I'm the one who came here to end his reign. Permanently.\" \nAdam Warlock paused and looked at Venom. He had not expected to find himself fighting alongside a creature of such darkness. But he would gladly accept any ally willing to join him in his crusade. \nThe battle for the fate of the universe was about to begin, and for the first time in ages, Venom felt as if he knew exactly who he was and where he belonged. \nHe would stand on the side of the light... as long as the faintest glimmer still remained...",

To prevent that future from happening, Venom knows he has only two options — kill the dark god Knull or imprison him on Klyntar and take his throne.",
    "UIHeroStoryTable_10350_Story_#1_Content": "Being trapped in a prison deep beneath the surface of the symbiote homeworld Klyntar might seem like a terrible fate to most, but Eddie Brock, quite familiar with being behind bars himself, was well aware that things were about to get far worse.\nUp on the planet’s surface, mistakes had been made. Big mistakes. And now, the worst case scenario had finally played out. The primordial force of darkness known as Knull had broken free from his confinement within Klyntar’s core and was about to extinguish every trace of light — and with it, every trace of life — in the known universe. The only positive is now having his bond torn asunder, his own memories started to return.\nEddie tried hard not to blame himself. After all, there were many others who had unwittingly contributed to the chaos that had just unfolded. But not a single hero who had come to Klyntar to fight against Knull knew the King in Black better than Eddie did. As Venom, Eddie and his symbiotic partner should have been the ones leading their allies to a glorious victory. Instead, they ended up being torn apart by Hela — Knull’s new Queen in Black — and thrown into separate cells to rot. They had been removed from play right when they were needed the most. And now, the universe was doomed. Unless they managed to do something… fast…\nNot long after Eddie had awoken in his cell, a few unfamiliar symbiotes had oozed their way between its bars. At first, Eddie thought they had been sent by Knull to devour him, but he soon realized that they were running from something. Eddie wondered what could possibly have inspired such fear in some of the most terrifying creatures in the galaxy. But as the heat beneath the surface of Klyntar began to climb, Eddie started to suspect what might have caused such panic.\nEarlier, when he was still half of Venom, he had watched as the Phoenix Force — a powerful cosmic entity that had attempted to protect itself by taking the form of an egg — was broken into fragments. The intense heat released when that egg shattered ended up searing a hole through Klyntar’s surface, providing Knull the means to escape. Venom never saw what happened to the shards of the Phoenix Egg after it fractured. He was too busy being choked out by Hela at that moment. But now, based on the rapidly rising temperature and the trembling symbiotes surrounding him, he knew that one of the fragments must be close by. And if he wanted another shot at taking down Knull, the cosmic power contained within that shard might be his only hope.\nOne problem, though. Eddie’s symbiote wasn’t keen on that plan. Although they had been thrown in separate cells, they were still able to communicate via their deep symbiotic bond. The symbiote reminded Eddie that, by their nature, his species was afraid of fire. It was a primal fear that had been passed down through the generations after the very first symbiote — All-Black — was created in the flames of a Celestial forge. Eddie was well aware of his partner’s weaknesses. But he tried to reassure the symbiote that facing a little bit of flame now would be a hell of a lot better than the eternity of darkness that Knull was planning to unleash.\nEddie quickly reconsidered that notion, however, when a trail of flames started to quickly advance down the long corridor leading to his cell. The fire blazed brighter and hotter than any he had ever seen or felt. The Phoenix’s flames were the flames of creation itself, burning since the dawn of time. And no human, other than those chosen to be the Phoenix’s host, could hope to withstand their intensity.\nEddie didn’t want to be burned alive, so he grabbed ahold of the bars of his cell, tugging on them with all of his might in hopes of bending or breaking them. Since the entire planet was made from living symbiotic plasma, Eddie shouldn’t have been surprised when the bars suddenly grew sharp fangs that pierced through his hands like giant thorns. Eddie let out a howl, but the pain didn’t stop him. He kept pulling on the bars until they finally snapped and then fell limp to the ground in front of him.\nFinally free from his cell, Eddie ignored his wounds and followed the voice screaming in his head until he reached another cell nearby. This one had a solid wall instead of bars, to prevent the symbiote inside from slithering its way out. But Eddie wasn’t about to let any obstacle keep him from reuniting with his partner. He looked down and saw that the other symbiotes had followed him out of his own cell. He reached his bloodied hands down toward them, and they knew what to do. Wrapping themselves around his fists like gloves, the symbiotes shielded Eddie’s hands from further damage as he repeatedly pummeled at the door to his partner’s cell. Finally, he managed to break through.\nThe other symbiotes were well aware of who their imprisoned sibling was, so they dared not try to forge their own bonds with Eddie. Instead, they simply dropped from his hands and made way for Eddie’s own symbiote to reclaim its proper place in their union. As the symbiote eagerly launched itself out of its cell and onto its human host, Eddie couldn’t help but smile. They were whole again. Together, they were Venom. But as much as Eddie wanted to revel in the moment, there was work to be done… and time was running out…\nThe tunnels beneath Klyntar weren’t just filling with flame, they were also trembling violently. It was clear that the entire planet was on the verge of annihilation due to the war with Knull taking place on the surface. Eddie tried to convince his partner that they needed to acquire greater power if they wanted to stop Knull, and that the fragment of the Phoenix Egg was by far their best option. \nThe symbiote protested, but Eddie refused to give up, eventually convincing his other half to reluctantly give his plan a try. Both of them knew that this could very well be their final mission, but they had no other choice. They took a deep breath and then raced at full speed down the corridor toward the source of the flames. They tried to ignore the searing pain as they ran through the scorching columns of fire, but it wasn’t long before they were overwhelmed by its cosmic fury. They knew they couldn’t handle much more… but if they were going to perish, at least they would be together.\nAs Venom collapsed to their knees, the fire surrounding them suddenly parted. There, directly in front of their dark form, appeared a gorgeous woman with hair as red as a summer sunset. At first Eddie thought he must be hallucinating, but as soon as the woman spoke, her powerful voice echoing in his mind, he realized that she was a manifestation of the Phoenix Force itself in human form.\nThe Phoenix told Venom that they had nothing to fear. She said that she was a force of creation, and as such, she loved all forms of life, even those born of the darkness. Furthermore, she had always been drawn to strong emotions in mortals… and in all her eons of existence, she had never felt a bond quite as strong as the one shared between Eddie and his symbiote. Their echoed the strength of her bond with Jean Grey, this time communicating to the symbiote, and how over many years, both of their connections with their chosen allies evolved beyond “host” to kinship. The Phoenix, despite a cosmic force with much greater concerns, admitted that she would never forgive herself if she let something so beautiful and pure be consumed by her own flames. She vowed that, as long as her fire still burned, they would be under her protection.\nVenom smiled as the Phoenix faded from view. Eddie had promised to keep his symbiote safe from harm, but he wasn’t sure that his partner truly believed him. Now, he had all the proof he needed. As they rose to their feet again, Venom no longer felt any pain or fear. They just felt united determination to face the being from before the dawn of the universe in battle and end his dark reign once and for all. And now they had the means to do it. There, right in front of them, where the ethereal red-haired woman had just stood moments ago, was the fragment of the Phoenix Egg.\nAs Venom reached their hand out toward the shard, Eddie mentally paused and checked with his symbiote one last time to make sure that he was ready to do what had to be done. The symbiote told Eddie that, as long as they were together, he was ready for anything the universe could throw at them. But in truth, neither Eddie nor his partner were properly prepared for what came next.\nThe moment Venom grabbed ahold of the Phoenix fragment, their entire body was engulfed in cosmic flame. But this time, the fire didn’t burn from the outside. Instead, it burned from the inside with the intensity of a new star being born. And it felt sublime.\nTogether, Eddie and his symbiote had always been Venom… but now, bonded with the Phoenix Force as well, they were something entirely new and different. They were the perfect balance of dark and light. They were two primal forces, at odds since the dawn of time, yet now joined together in perfect unison. And most importantly, they were ready to take their new power to the throne of Knull and use it to send their god back into the oblivion he belonged.\nIf Venom had their way, the King in Black’s reign was about to come to its fiery end. But even with a portion of the Phoenix Force at their disposal, Venom wasn’t about to enter the fray unprepared. They remembered all too well what had happened when they tried to take on Hela barehanded. If they wanted to win this battle, they would need a weapon capable of holding its own against the symbiote’s great ad infinitum grandma…Knull’s fabled Necrosword…All-Black… and, thankfully, he knew exactly where find one…",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10360000_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "Every week or so, Peter Parker swung uptown from his usual haunts to the Manhattan side of the Queensboro Bridge, looking across toward home. And every week, there was still no way to get there. There were too many vampires patrolling the bridge, and other horrific monsters flying over it. Dracula had taken Manhattan all for himself, and he wasn’t letting any of his human “playthings” escape.\n\nStill Peter came by to look, wishing he could talk to Aunt May. Every Wednesday. That’s when he missed Aunt May the most, because ever since he’d moved out of her house, he’d always tried to get back to see her for lunch on Wednesdays.\n\nToday, he was staying a little farther away from the bridge, watching it from the Midtown Tunnel’s ventilation tower, a mile downstream past the U.N. headquarters. It was a quiet place for contemplation, since the huge fans were no longer running. He had cased the area for vampires before letting himself have his weekly moment of regret and longing for a world before the Timestream Entanglement. Before the vampires had taken over New York. Before he had lost track of the days since he’d seen the sun. \n\nGazing at the bridge under the dead eye of the Blood Moon, Peter was lost in his head, thinking about two things at once:\n\nOne, he was frustrated about not being allowed to help out with the construction of the Timestream Reintegration Device that Reed Richards and Tony Stark had been working on. For some reason, they felt that Peter would be more useful swinging through the streets and webbing up vampires as Spider-Man than contributing his own brand of scientific expertise to their little super-genius think tank.  \n\nTwo, he was remembering when he had been here the week before, about the same time — although it was hard to know what time it was when the sun never came up and the moon always hung full over the river. He’d been wishing he could see Aunt May, just like tonight, when he noticed a twinkling in the air, just in front of him. It got a little brighter, and a folded piece of paper appeared out of nowhere, pinched between two fingers. The hand disappeared and the piece of paper drifted down to rest on Peter’s right knee.\n\nHuh, he thought. That didn’t happen every day.\n\nHe unfolded the paper and read:\n\nPeter,\n\nThe Master Weaver told me to find you and tell you that the Web of Life and Destiny needs you. I will reach out again when it is time for you to come here. That time will be soon.\n\nSpider-Zero\n\nSpider-Zero? Master Weaver? Peter had never heard of either, nor did he have any idea what the Web of Life and Destiny might be. But this was the day he would finally find out. As he silently gazed toward Queens, a portal popped open next to him. A young woman was on the other side. \n\n“So… I’m guessing you’re Spider-Zero, eh?” Peter said. “Do you happen to have an actual real-person name?”\n\nShe ignored his question. “We need you, Peter. The Web of Life and Destiny needs you.”\n\n“I don’t —” Peter paused for a moment before saying what he really meant. “I belong here.”\n\n“Spider-Man belongs everywhere,” Spider-Zero responded, cryptically. “Come with me and I’ll show you.”\n\nPeter didn’t want to go through the portal. Something told him it would be hard to get back, for any number of possible reasons, and he couldn’t take the chance. So instead, Spider-Zero showed him the Web of Life and Destiny through the rift. The night sky beyond it blazed with portals and stars. The city below it — so, so far below it — was a dark splendor of neon-lit towers and shadows, extending to the horizon in every direction.\n\n“See, Peter? This is your destiny,” Spider-Zero said. “Our destiny. If the Web fails, all Spider-People will disappear. Including you. And not too long after that, reality comes apart. The Web is what holds it all together.”\n\nHis gut told him to leap into action and save the universe, but in his heart, Peter knew that he had to say no. At least for now. His city needed him more. \n\n“If things get worse, you know where to find me,” he said. “I’ll try to come and help, but New York is my home. I belong here.”\n\nSpider-Zero didn’t press him further, but she did say she would be coming back. Peter didn’t argue. \n\nAs the portal faded away, Peter started thinking that the Web might be like the model of the universe Tony Stark had talked about, with dimensions wrapped up in tight strings that vibrated through space-time and intersected, well, like a web. Peter knew a little about string theory, but the way Tony talked about space-time when he and Reed were working out the math for the TRD? That was just a bit beyond Peter’s reach. He could see what it was the same way he could see what Arthur Douglas was doing on the saxophone. Actually doing it himself was a whole other level. Peter was a bit crestfallen at having to admit this to himself, but hey, at least he still had streets to patrol and citizens to save from vampires and other creatures of the night. \n\nCould be worse.\n\n“There you are!” a more familiar voice called out, snapping Peter back into reality. He glanced up to see Johnny Storm — the Human Torch — rapidly approaching, fully flamed-on. \n\n“No more sitting here and moping about how much you miss Aunt May’s wheatcakes, Petey,” Johnny said. “We’ve got work to do!”\n\n“Didn’t we just defeat a Deviant Mutate together, like, an hour ago?” Peter asked. The two heroes had long been best friends and had enjoyed countless team-ups over the years, but the frequency of their joint missions together had increased exponentially since the city had fallen under the curse of never-ending night. \n\n“That’s already old news,” Johnny laughed. “I’ve incinerated at least a dozen more vamps since then all on my lonesome. But Reed just sent me some juicy new intel that’s gonna blow your mind!” \n\n“Please don’t let it be a vampire Galactus…” Peter muttered nervously under his breath.\n\n“Way better,” Johnny said with a confident smile. “Blade finally showed up!” \n\n“Blade?!” Peter said with genuine surprise. The vampire hunter had been mysteriously missing-in-action ever since Dracula’s hordes first descended upon the island of Manhattan. Peter breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that Blade’s expertise in battling vampires could really help the heroes turn the tide back in their favor. It was almost too good to be true! \n\n“Squirrel Girl’s crew claims to have seen him in Central Park twenty minutes ago,” Johnny continued, beginning to fly toward the center of the city. “We have to find him… before you-know-who does!” \n\nPeter immediately leapt from his perch, spinning a strand of webbing and swinging after the Human Torch. Johnny was moving fast, but Peter could easily follow the trail of flame that his friend left in the air behind him. \n\nAs the duo descended to the southeast corner of Central Park, they couldn’t believe their eyes. There he was: a half-man, half-vampire warrior clad in all black, grinning as he furiously swung his swords at a group of oncoming vampires. His sharp fangs glinted in the light of the Blood Moon. There was no doubt about it. This was Blade, the legendary Daywalker. And, suddenly, both Peter and Johnny felt a lot more hope. \n\n“You just gonna stand there starin’, boys?” Blade asked, not even looking up from his foes. “Or are you gonna help me take down these damn fangers?” \n\n“Oh, yeah! Sorry!” Peter said, leaping into action, rapidly shooting a barrage of webs at the feet of the vampire horde. “I just don’t think either of us expected to see you here.” \n\n“You and me both,” Blade mused. “Been on a secret recon mission tryin’ to figure out how the hell Dracula made New York his new turf.” \n\n“Any luck?” Johnny asked. \n\n“Found a few leads,” Blade said, his tone instantly becoming much more serious. “But they all sounded a bit hard to believe.”\n\n“Says the guy currently in a sword fight with vampires,” Spidey jested. Blade didn’t even crack a smile. But, to be fair, he didn’t have much reason to.   \n\nAs much as Blade hated vampires, vampires had always hated Blade right back. Not only because he was constantly hunting them down and ending their immortality early, but also because they were extremely jealous of him. Blade had something that no other vampire had — the ability to survive in the sunlight. Peter worried that fact alone would make his friend Draculas’ Most Wanted. \n\nSee, even though the city was shrouded in darkness for the moment, Dracula had to know that his little ploy wouldn’t last forever. If he could use this opportunity to find a more permanent solution to his brood’s limitations, however — a solution that was likely to be found in Blade’s hybrid blood — then he wouldn’t need to rely on an Empire of Eternal Night anymore. No matter the time of day, vampires would rule the city… and, eventually, the world… \n\nAs Peter pondered the chilling possibilities, he continued to web shut fang-filled mouths as swiftly as he could. Meanwhile, Johnny and Blade were busy using more lethal methods to eliminate their undead attackers. Johnny unleashed powerful bursts of superheated plasma to incinerate the vampire soldiers, while Blade effortlessly sliced his foes into bits with his swords. Peter tried not to throw up in his mask, both from the sight and the smell. Soon, the chaos subsided and the three heroes were the only men left standing. \n\n“Was that it?” Peter asked, well aware of the mistake he had just made the second the words left his lips. His spider-sense immediately let him know that even greater danger lurked nearby. Classic Parker luck.\n\n“Calm before the storm,” Blade said knowingly. \n\n“Indeed,” a sinister voice responded as Dracula himself stepped out of the shadows, his blood red cape gently swaying in the breeze. \n\n“Dracula?” Johnny exclaimed, almost excited. The lord of the vampires had rarely left his castle since this nightmare began. “Big mistake showing your pasty face in public, pal!” \n\nThe Human Torch released an enormous burst of flames in Dracula’s direction, but the vampire king dodged out of the way uncanny speed. Peter unloaded burst after burst of webbing toward Dracula as well, but fared no better when it came to hitting his target. Their foe was far too fast. \n\n“Takes a vamp to beat a vamp,” Blade said, raising both of his swords as he pushed between his new allies and lunged at Dracula. \n\n“You speak true,” Dracula responded as he unsheathed his two ornate swords and met Blade in combat. “And since you are only half a vampire, it is clear who shall claim victory.” \n\nSparks flew as metal clashed. For every thrust of Blade’s weapons, Dracula had a perfect counterattack that left the vampire hunter growling with frustration. Despite Blade’s undeniable combat skill, Spidey could see that the Daywalker was out-matched. The hunter was about to become the prey if Peter didn’t do something fast. \n\n“Get ready to light it up, Johnny,” Peter said. His fantastic friend nodded, knowing what to do next. \n\nAs Peter launched another bombardment of web blasts from his wristbands, Johnny produced a wall of flame directly in their path. As the dense balls of webbing passed through the flames, they instantly ignited. The burning projectiles impacted Dracula, setting his cape ablaze and distracting him for a mere moment — a moment Blade eagerly took advantage of.\n\n“Nice steel you’ve got there, Vlad,” Blade said, kicking the legendary Sword of Dracula from his foe’s hand. “Think I’ll add ‘em to my collection.” Blade quickly wrenched the smaller yet equally legendary blade from this undead king’s claws.\n\n“And I shall add your head to mine!” Dracula snarled back. Even though he had been disarmed, Dracula still managed to dodge Blade’s frenzy of attacks. \n\nWhile the two vampires clashed, Peter released a heavy spray of webbing at Dracula’s feet, stopping him in his tracks for a moment. But just as Spidey swung in to deliver a swift kick to Dracula’s pointy teeth, the vampiric villain turned himself into a black mist, freeing himself from the webs and sending Spidey soaring straight through him. \n\n“Hey, Blade,” Johnny yelled, “let’s show this jerk how we like our stakes!” \n\nBlade grabbed a pair of sharp wooden spikes from his bandolier and hurled them through the air, straight at Dracula’s heart. Johnny lit up the sharp stakes with two quick bursts of flame as they hurtled toward their deadly destination. \n\n“Well done,” Dracula said as he used his lightning-fast reflexes to bat the burning stakes out of the sky split seconds before they could pierce his undead flesh. “But I prefer my meat bloody.” \n\nDracula suddenly turned his attention back to Peter, leaping through the air and clutching the hero by the throat. \n\n“And you will make the perfect appetizer,” Dracula growled, lifting Peter into the air with one hand. Peter squirmed to break free from the vampire’s grip, but to no avail. Peter could feel Dracula’s fingers tightening around his larynx. For once, the Amazing Spider-Man was truly speechless. His vision began to cloud with darkness as he gasped for air. Dracula leaned in, his fangs ready to sink into the sinew of Peter’s neck.\n\n“You don’t want him,” Blade said, slicing at Dracula from behind with his sword. Dracula loosened his hold and Peter slumped to the ground, gasping. “It’s me you’re after.”\n\n“And it is you I shall have,” Dracula said confidently. \n\nEverything that happened after that was a blur. Peter tried to get back on his feet and back in the game, but he quickly realized that he never stood a chance against Dracula, even with Blade and the Human Torch on his side. \n\nThe lord of the vampires attacked Peter’s friends ferociously, turning himself into a giant dragon-like bat and using a flap of his massive wings to extinguish the Human Torch’s flames, knocking Johnny unconscious in the process. \n\nAll Peter could do was watch helplessly as Dracula’s monstrous form swooped down and grabbed Blade in his claws, lifting the vampire hunter into the air. Despite his efforts, Blade couldn’t manage to break free from Dracula’s grip. The hideous creature passed in front of the Blood Moon as he dragged his prey back to his castle… and the unspeakable horrors that waited within.\n\nAs everything faded to black, Peter Parker wondered if maybe he should have gone through that portal after all…",

What he failed to realize was that the biggest threat to Krakoa wouldn’t come from Earth… at least not directly… \n\nAfter the Gala began, the Krakoan gateways — which offered Mutants instant access to the island from various strategic points across the universe — were somehow hijacked by an invading army of artificial life forms led by the antagonistic android Ultron. As far as Magneto could tell from the mechanical madman’s rantings, this version of Ultron had been built on Earth decades ago, but had subsequently been banished to the stars by the Avengers. Now, something had summoned Ultron back home, and he was determined to assimilate Earth into his growing cosmic empire during his visit. Krakoa was just another stop on his world domination tour. But if Magneto and his allies banded together and stopped Ultron now, it could very well be his last.\n\nChaos and carnage quickly erupted across the island as seemingly endless waves of Ultron’s armed automatons arrived on the scene. As most of the Mutant and human heroes who had assembled on Krakoa worked to fend off the streams of synthetic soldiers, Magneto turned his focus on finding the one true Ultron and ending his existence. And now, he had finally found his foe, who was currently distracted by the brutal attacks of a very angry Hulk dressed in the tatters of a suit. Magneto saw the opportunity to strike and seized it. \n\n“No more, Ultron!” Magneto shouted as he rose into the air on a wave of magnetic force. “Krakoa is a free nation… and you shall not take it from us!” \n\nUltron didn’t even bother to turn and look at Magneto. Instead, he dispatched dozens of his drones to attack the Mutant leader. But with just a wave of his hand, Magneto crumpled the legion of robotic soldiers into tiny spheres of scrap that rained down upon Krakoa’s lush surface. \n\nMagneto would not be insulted further by entertaining Ultron’s puppet soldiers. He wished to face the true threat head on. He generated a massive sphere of magnetic energy between his hands, ready to unleash it at Ultron. \n\n“Consider this battle —” \n\nBefore the Mutant Master of Magnetism could release his energy wave and complete his declaration of victory, he was unexpectedly hit with a powerful blast that seared a hole straight through his reinforced armor. It seemed that Ultron knew the threat Magneto posed after all, swiftly and silently removing his foe from the game board. As his body plummeted to the ground below, Magneto knew his battle was nearly over.\n\n“Magneto!” Captain America yelled, racing over to aid his fallen Mutant ally. “Hang on, soldier. We didn’t both survive World War II only to be taken down by some rusty pile of —”\n\nThe Captain stopped himself suddenly. He had seen countless allies fall on the field of battle over his years in service, so he knew a fatal wound when he saw one. Magneto wouldn’t last much longer. \n\n“Do not fret, Captain,” Magneto said, a strangely reassuring tone in his voice. “I have died… many times before… and this… won’t be the last…” \n\nAs Captain America held Magneto in his arms, the Mutant leader’s vision began to fade from red, white and blue to a deep black. \n\nMany humans believe that a person’s entire life flashes before their eyes in the seconds before their death. But the Mutants of Krakoa know otherwise. For them, their entire lives — every memory and every moment — flashes before their eyes in the seconds before their rebirth. This is a side effect of the Resurrection Protocols, a process in which a full scan of their minds is downloaded from Cerebro into a brand new body grown in the Krakoan Hatchery. It is a delicate process, but one that has given countless Mutants another chance at life. And today, that chance belonged to Magneto.\n\nAfter what somehow seemed like both a split second and an eternity, the black of the void gave way to a blinding display of memories. Magneto saw his life as a young boy in Europe. His days as a prisoner in a concentration camp. The unexpected discovery of his Mutant powers. His first meeting with Charles Xavier. The countless battles he fought for Mutant supremacy and, eventually, equality. And when his memories finally raced to the point where Ultron struck him down, Magneto emerged from his pod in the Hatchery, gasping for air, alive and whole once more.\n\nWithout a word or a moment of hesitation, Magneto used his powers to call forth the metallic elements buried in the Krakoan soil, fashioning himself a new suit of armor far more durable than his last. He then exited the Hatchery and headed to find Ultron. It would be easier to locate the villain this time, as Magneto had sensed a strange, otherworldly element in the alloy that covered the exterior of Ultron’s frame. He honed in on that unique metallic signature and followed it to the heart of Krakoa, where he found Ultron swiftly approaching.\n\n“Curious,” Ultron said upon seeing Magneto alive and well. “I thought your life signs had been extinguished. When I detected your bio-signature suddenly return at another location, I had to investigate the anomaly.”\n\n“I am no anomaly,” Magneto replied, hurling long spears of reshaped scrap metal toward Ultron at a furious speed. “Like so many of my Mutant brethren, I have simply been reborn.” \n\n“And you will be reborn once more,” Ultron said, his devilish grin glowing in the darkness of the Krakoan jungle. “This time in my image.” \n\nExpecting a physical attack, Magneto erected an enormous metal shield in front of his body to protect himself from harm. But this time, Ultron released a cloud of techno-organic nano-bots that swiftly navigated past Magneto’s shield and surrounded the Mutant’s helmeted head. Magneto had already inhaled thousands of the microscopic machines before he could even think to create an electromagnetic aura around his body to repel them. Mere moments later, Magneto could already hear Ultron’s voice buzzing inside of his head. \n\n“Could this be…?” Ultron said, as his mind linked with Magneto’s via the nano-bots’ neural network. “Do you Mutants truly have a machine capable of resurrection? A way of growing powerful new bodies and downloading your consciousness into them? I simply must give it a test run!”  \n\nMagneto fought past the pain of his body’s techno-organic invaders and reached out toward Ultron with all of his magnetic might. That much force should have instantly ripped Ultron asunder, but the sinister synthezoid’s body barely bent. \n\n“The techno-organic virus I infected you with is programmed to prevent you from doing any harm to me,” Ultron gloated. “But even if it weren’t, your powers would have little effect. My current form is forged of Mysterium. I’ve found it to be nearly immune to this planet’s basic laws of nature and physics. Still, as impressive as that is, I can’t help but wonder what my next body will be capable of. I have a feeling we’ll find out soon enough…”\n\nWith that, Ultron departed, heading toward the Cradle where Cerebro was stored. Magneto tried to give chase, but found himself locked in a new war — one with his very own body. The machines in his bloodstream were swiftly replicating and seizing control. Because of their unique alien techno-organic composition, they contained almost no traces of magnetic metals, which meant that Magneto could not expel them from his body… a body they were claiming more and more of with each passing second. \n\nFor a moment, Magneto considered using his powers to impale himself on a metal pike, strategically triggering the Resurrection Protocols again so that he could be reborn in a body free of the virus. But if Ultron managed to get his hands on Cerebro, it could disrupt the entire process, making Magneto’s next death — and the death of every other Mutant — far more permanent. \n\nInstead, Magneto decided to forge ahead, struggling to make his way out of the dense jungle. Eventually, he found himself at the foot of a statue built in honor of Charles Xavier — the founder of the X-Men and one of the driving forces behind the great nation of Krakoa. Magneto caught a glimpse of his reflection in the plaque at the statue’s base. Nearly half of his body had already been converted into techno-organic matter by the virus, and it was spreading fast. Magneto gazed up at the larger-than-life figure of his old friend and thought back to the many years they had spent together, both as enemies and as allies. \n \n“Charles…” Magneto struggled to say “…is this… how the dream dies…?”\n\nNo. A familiar voice responded inside of Magneto’s brain. Not like this. Not today. \n\nMagneto didn’t know if he was hallucinating, reliving a distant memory, or actually communicating with his long lost friend. But it didn’t matter. Hearing Charles’ voice in his head once more gave him the strength he needed to turn the tide of the battle within himself. \n\nMagneto knew he couldn’t take control of the nano-bots that had flooded his bloodstream, but he could take control of the bloodstream itself, thanks to the iron in the hemoglobin of his red blood cells. If he could consciously slow his blood flow, he could halt the techno-organic virus's advance. Magneto focused all his power inward and, within moments, he could feel the pain beginning to cease and the control over his body returning.\n\n“Not like this, Ultron,” Magneto said, echoing the words of his oldest ally as he returned to his feet and prepared to head back into the fray. “Not today.”",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10370010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "As he gazed off into the distance towards the line where the ocean met the sky, Magneto's cape fluttered gently in the calm breeze that was drifting across the coast of the sentient island nation of Krakoa. His was a life far longer than most people ever had the chance to live, and this was one of the few moments of true peace that he could recall. But he knew from experience it would not last for long. It never did. \n\"Something on your mind, old man?\" a familiar voice asked from above, breaking the silence. As Magneto glanced up, there, hovering on the wind like a majestic goddess, was Ororo Munroe — the Mutant weather manipulator known as Storm. \n\"Funny, isn't it,\" mused Magneto, \"that we fought all those years for a better future for Mutantkind… and now we have finally found it, further in the future than any of us ever imagined.\"\nNot so long ago, the sovereign nation of Krakoa had been swept up in a chronal storm — a time-twisting anomaly that would have ripped the island to bits if not for Ororo's deft manipulation of its tumultuous currents. Instead of becoming lost in the timestream forever, Krakoa arrived safely on the other side of the tempest in the year 2099. The future that Mutantkind had always dreamed of was finally theirs to claim. And Magneto was never one to let such an auspicious opportunity pass him by. \n\"It matters not what century we are in,\" Storm said. \"What matters is that our people have a home here on Krakoa, thanks to you, Erik…\" \nMagneto cringed as his old friend called him by his human name. True, he had gone by many of them over the decades — Max Eisenhardt, Erik Lehnsherr, Magnus — but they were monikers he had merely tolerated in order to better fit into a world where Homo Sapiens still believed themselves in control. Here, in this new era, he could choose a name that spoke to who he truly was. Magneto — the Mutant Master of Magnetism. \n\"I may be leading the cause to find our fellow Mutants and bring them to this safe harbor, my dear,\" said Magneto, \"but the success of this crusade cannot be attributed to one Mutant alone.\" \n\"You're damn right it can't, bub,\" a grizzled voice snarled from the edge of the jungle that bordered Krakoa's shore. \nMagneto and Storm both turned to see a familiar figure walking out of a newly-blossomed Krakoan gate. The short, hairy figure looked as though he had just been to hell and back. And knowing Wolverine, that could very literally be the case. Alongside Wolverine stood a young Mutant, just old enough for her powers to begin manifesting.\n\"Found the kid who got sucked through that dimensional rift,\" Wolverine continued. \"She's lucky I went in there after her. Limbo is no place for a new Mutant.\"\n\"I couldn't disagree more,\" another voice said, this one with a hint of a Russian accent. \"This New Mutant has managed just fine there.\" \n\"Illyana? Can it truly be?!\" Storm rushed over to the young woman who had just stepped through the gateway, instantly wrapping her in an embrace. For years, Illyana Rasputin, the Mutant teleporter known as Magik, had been like a daughter to Storm. Before she was claimed by the darkness of Limbo… Before… \n\"Nice to see you too, Windrider,\" said Magik with an uncomfortable smirk. \"It's been… longer than I care to remember…\" \nMagneto stepped towards the new arrival, not embracing her, but examining her closely instead. There was something strange about her. It was clear that she had walked a far different path than the Illyana Rasputin of his world. This child had been hardened by the horrors of war, something to which Magneto himself could closely relate. \n\"You are not the child we once knew,\" Magneto said. \"But you are welcome here on Krakoa. All Mutants are, regardless from where or when they hail.\" \n\"How about people who grew up thinking they were Mutants, only to have their entire world turned upside down when they learned the truth years later…?\"\nMagneto audibly gasped as the question was asked by another woman who had just arrived through the Krakoan gateway. His gaze instantly shifted over to her as she walked forward. Her every step stirred ripples across his memory, for he had been there when she had taken her very first ones so many years ago.\n\"Wanda…\" \n\"Hello, father,\" the Scarlet Witch said as she approached Magneto with a calm confidence that few had ever shown in his presence. She reached up and began to slowly remove Magneto's helmet, an action that would almost certainly be met with instant retaliation should anyone else attempt it. But Magneto stood as silent as solid steel, simply basking in the magic of his long lost daughter's company. His stoic expression softened as Wanda leaned in and gave him a gentle kiss on the cheek. \n\"How… How can you be here?\" Magneto managed to say. He could bend Adamantium into any shape with his Mutant power, but these simple words were somehow nearly impossible to form. \n\"It took a bit of work,\" Wanda mused. \"I'm not technically a Mutant like you, after all, which means Krakoa wouldn't normally let me through its gates. But a touch of chaos magic did the trick.\" \n\"What I meant to say is…\" \n\"Oh…\" Wanda's playful tone vanished faster than a stage magician's pet rabbit. \"Your Wanda… She's gone, isn't she? I'm sorry… This must be difficult…\" \n\"Quite the opposite,\" Magneto said, regaining his composure. \"To see your face again, to hear your voice, to know that — somewhere in this vast Multiverse a version of you has thrived — is perhaps the least difficult thing I could ever conceive. It is all that any father ever wants.\"  \n\"I wouldn't say I've been thriving, exactly,\" Wanda admitted. \"I've been holding my own universe together by its threads for far too long. I truly believed that I was its only hope to survive.\"\n\"Like father, like daughter,\" chuckled Wolverine. \n\"But I've started to see the bigger picture,\" Wanda continued. \"We're all fighting our own wars. The only chance we have of winning them and keeping all of our universes intact is if we start fighting together.\" \n\"Speakin' of fightin', I'm late for a date with Natasha,\" Wolverine said. \"We've got ourselves a tin-plated dictator that needs overthrowin'.\"\nMagneto almost chastised Wolverine for entrenching himself in the petty squabbles between the humans of this era, but he paused for a moment and considered his daughter's words. Perhaps she was right. Perhaps his own war to preserve Mutantkind was just one battle of many, all of them equally important.\n\"Since Krakoa arrived in this future, my allegiance has been to Mutantkind alone,\" said Magneto. \"I felt it best to isolate our people in order to protect them. But your words inspire me, my dear. It is clear that no Mutant is an island.\" \n\"Except Krakoa, da?\" Magik chimed in playfully. \n\"In order to commit to such an alliance, however, it must be a mutually beneficial one,\" Magneto continued. \"There are still Mutants out there, lost across space and time, who require our assistance in order to lead them home.\" \n\"That sounds like the perfect task for a Sorceress Supreme,\" Wanda said. \"But I'll require your help. As fond as I am of your classic look, I think we're in need of use a helmet that's a bit more functional.\"\n\"Of course,\" Magneto said, raising his hand into the air. Within moments, tiny scraps of metal buried beneath the sand of Krakoa's beaches converged and reshaped themselves into a complex yet familiar device once worn by Charles Xavier himself — Cerebro. \n\"If I recall, old school Cerebro was capable of tracking down Mutants anywhere in the world,\" said Wanda. \"But a few arcane enhancements should expand the helmet's search area to include adjacent dimensions as well. Like you said, all Mutants are welcome here, regardless from where or when they hail.\"\n\"Well?\" said Magik, her eyes burning with anticipation. \"Try it on already, old man!\" \nThe moment Magneto put on the helmet, he saw flashes of powerful Mutants scattered across the Multiverse. A telepathic ninja trapped in a strange world of unholy amusements. A king of the seas preparing to strike at the unsuspecting surface world. A powerful cosmic presence determined to burn the darkness out of the night sky. And thousands more, each yearning to defy fate and to find their place in an ever-shifting cavalcade of timelines and realities. \n\"There is much work to be done,\" Magneto said. \"Far more than I expected. When do we begin?\" \n\"No time better than the present…\" said Magik. \"Or the future, I guess. Wherever we are.\" \n\"You have given Mutants a gift this day, Wanda,\" Magneto said proudly. \"Your efforts will not be forgotten.\"\n\"I'm going to hold you to that,\" Wanda replied. \"And when the time comes, the army that you're about to gather may very well be the one that tips the balance in our favor.\"\n\"Then let this be a call to all Mutants across time and space,\" Magneto continued. \"The gates of Krakoa are open to them. In the words of a dear old friend…\" \n\"…to me, my X-Men.\"",

She was surrounded by a low wall, beyond which the cliffs and ridges of Wundagore Mountain sloped away into the clouds below. \nShe did this every day, opening her mind to the vast magical undercurrents of her broken world. Sensing where arcane power was building, where different forms of magic clashed and threatened wider conflicts. Reality was fragile, filled with gods and monsters that would willingly destroy it to increase their own power.\nWanda.\nShe twitched, the sound of her name pricking at the bubble of meditation. Wanda had spent years honing her ability to detect the smallest fluctuations in the field of magical power woven into the fabric of reality. This was part of her task as Sorceress Supreme of a reality that constantly tried to tear itself apart. Whenever magical adepts were active, she needed to know. Not to mention, it had been quite some time since someone used her name.\nWanda.\nThe words were laced with a shadowy tinge vaguely familiar to her, but from beyond her realm. That put her on the defensive. Only dangerous magic could traverse the spaces between universes. She was the Sorceress Supreme of this universe and she had tasted dark magic many a time before. Her unique mastery of chaos had transformed her into a primal force of order. When the immense tides of temporal power threatened to tear this universe apart, it was Wanda who felt the surge and turned it aside. Tamed it, held it in check. \nUntil it surged again.\nAnd it always did, because this universe was an entangled battleground, and she the only one who could hold its fibers together.\nSince the cataclysmic disruption of space-time itself, Wanda had spent more and more time locked in an arcane clash few people in her reality could even detect. The collapse of different histories had brought mighty enemies together and unleashed vast forces. Wanda knew she was, in the end, her reality’s last line of defense, the only magical force capable of keeping the conflicting timestreams from ripping her world apart. If magical power were to surge unchecked, her reality would be annihilated. \nWanda.\nThe voice seemed familiar. Perhaps someone she had known, an echo of a soul long departed…\nWanda. It’s Stephen. Stephen Strange.\n“Stephen Strange?” \nThe sound of her voice carried in the thin mountain air, challenging the wind beyond her Sanctum. \nNot the Stephen Strange you know. \n“No, the Strange I knew is dead.” He had been a great sorcerer, but he had fallen in the final battle of the first Demon War, when Hell itself spilled over into what was once Las Vegas. Wanda remembered that day with great sadness. She had led a mighty band of arcane adepts to victory, but their losses had been great.\nThe voice — she had sensed its nature and now knew it to be an astral projection — sighed. \nYes, I’ve heard that a lot recently.\n“What do you mean?”\nI’ve tried to reach out to the Sorcerers Supreme of many different realities, Wanda. In most of those realities, I’m dead. In a few of them, other versions of me didn’t believe who I was. You’re the first person who has carried the conversation this far, and that’s good, because my world is in mortal danger and I need to be able to help it.\n“The Stephen Strange I knew could astrally project and then return to his body as if he was flipping a coin,” Wanda said.\nUsually I can too, but something about the Timestream Entanglement trapped me in… an entangled astral plane is the best way I can describe it. There are too many other versions of me. I can’t figure out which one of them is the correct one to return to.\nAh. Now she understood. “And you think I can?”\nI’m sure you can. Your powers ought to be perfectly tuned to sort through the chaos of this particular astral entanglement. You’re the Sorceress Supreme, aren’t you?\nThis little challenge put Wanda’s guard back up. “So are you, in your world.”\nRight. And I could probably figure it out through trial and error, over a period of years or decades or centuries back in the material plane. But by then, not even the Darkhold itself would be able to stop Dracula’s machinations.\nThose names refocused Wanda’s attention. She realized where she had tasted the darkness in those whispers before. The Darkhold was long gone from Wanda’s reality, but she had certainly heard of it. It contained the kind of knowledge she might be able to use…\nThe sun had traversed Wundagore’s peak and begun its plunge into the western mountains as Wanda decided to let down her guard and shift her full focus to the connection that she had established with this mystic from another reality. Finally, she could see the astral form of Stephen Strange before her. \nHe was a grander figure than the Strange she had known, mostly because he wore the regalia of the Sorcerer Supreme. She made a mental note to craft garments more fitting of her station… when she had the time. Most of Kamar-Taj had been wiped off the face of the planet ages ago. She had salvaged what she could, but had not thought to include any ritual clothing. \nAs she peered deeper into the Astral Plane, Wanda saw many other unexpected things as well. The skyline of what seemed to be New York City, but hanging upside down from the sky, as if mirrored from reality. An ancient Viking longship full of lost spirits, navigating a tumultuous sea of clouds in hopes of finding Valhalla. She even swore that she caught a brief glimpse of the corpse of one of the Old Ones she had recently defeated in an effort to protect her universe. It left her wondering exactly how closely her world was linked with this ethereal dimension. But that was a question for another time. There were more immediate matters at hand.\n“Tell me what Dracula is up to…” she said, her focus returning to Strange “…and what it has to do with the Darkhold. That book has not existed in this reality for decades, perhaps longer.”\nYou should be grateful for that.\n“Answer my question, Strange.”\nAbout what Dracula wants? Eternal night, of course. And he has already found the means to plunge my home dimension into it.   \n“And the Darkhold?” \nThe sun will always find a way to rise again. But the Darkhold contains a powerful spell that would let vampires walk in the daylight and turn all humanity into their prey.\nWanda could sense that Strange spoke the truth. \n“Wundagore is not far from Dracula’s realm,” she mused. “But in this world, his castle has been empty for a long time.”\nIn my world, his castle isn’t empty. But it also isn’t in Transylvania anymore.\n“Oh? Where is it?”\nCentral Park.\nStrange conjured up an astral image, showing Wanda the city of New York under a full moon. Even though it was just a memory, Wanda could still sense the terrible corruption pervading the city. Time had been perverted… \n“That moon isn’t moving,” she said.\nNo. Dracula has already performed a powerful blood ritual to imprison New York in an endless night. His strength is growing, and there aren’t nearly enough powerful people to resist him.\n“But you believe you can,” she pointed out.\nIdeally, yes. And I will. The resistance is going to need more help, though. The Timestream Entanglement has unleashed forces none of us ever even knew existed. Different histories colliding…\n“Yes, I’ve seen that.”\nAnd Chronovium complicates everything further.\n“Chronovium?”\nStrange’s astral form spread its hands and swept them back together. Out of nothing, seemingly, a shimmering crystal appeared in front of Wanda. \nThis is what it looks like where I come from. Though in your reality, it might take a different form.\nShe held a hand out and drew the crystal toward her. \n“Fascinating,” she breathed. “This was created by the entanglement?”\nThat’s right. Yet another delightful side effect of Victor’s tamperings… \nVictor… von Doom…? That was another name Wanda hadn’t heard in quite some time…  \n“How have I not noticed it until now?” she asked.\nYou’ve had a lot on your plate keeping your reality from utter annihilation. That chaos bubble of yours takes quite a bit of focus to maintain.\nThis was true, but Wanda was still shocked something like Chronovium could permeate her world without her being aware of it. \n“I seem to have been meditating a little too much,” she said.\nStrange didn’t argue. \n“It is time I took a more active role in the battles critical to the survival of my reality. I’ve been leaning too heavily on useful loose cannons,” she said.\nStrange nodded.\n“And will you help me, Strange?”\nIf you help me find a way home and aid in the battle against Dracula, I’ll be more than happy to bring a little something Strange back to your reality.\nHe cracked the barest hint of a smile. \n“And the Darkhold?” Wanda asked with great curiosity. “Where is it now?”\nI stored it here in the Astral Plane some time ago, in order to keep it out of the hands of another sorcerer who wished to use its spells for personal gain. \n“Then you have it with you?”\nNot quite. It has fallen into the hands of Khonshu, the god of the moon. He has threatened to use one of the forbidden formulas within it against Dracula. \n“Would that be such a bad thing?”\nThe rite would also eliminate the countless innocent lives that have fallen under the vampire lord’s sway. \n“I see,” Wanda said. “Is there any way to win the Darkhold back? I have heard Khonshu can’t resist a good game of skill.” \nAs have I. And he has already accepted my challenge. One well-played match of chess, and the book will be mine again. \n“Chess?” Wanda mused. “I’m surprised. I had always heard that Khonshu was far more fond of Senet…”  \nWhatever the case, I dare not lose. The fate of our all worlds depends on it. \n“Then win, Stephen Strange,” Wanda said, “and once you do, I will find a way to return you to your reality, Darkhold in hand.” \nAs Doctor Strange’s astral form faded, Wanda let out a sigh of relief. \nShe knew it would take every ounce of mystical might she could muster up to locate her new ally and extract him from his astral imprisonment. And even then, with her brand of chaos magic, the results might not be what either sorcerer hoped.\nBut Wanda also knew far more about the Darkhold’s sinister secrets than she had first let on. If she could possess it, delve into and master its mysteries, Wanda suspected she could at long last stop the decay of her universe. As Sorceress Supreme, she could wield its power to destroy the forces of magical entropy, end the endless wars between gods and immortals.\nSurely, if she helped this other Sorcerer Supreme save his world, he would see the truth and gladly return the favor. \nAnd if not, then Wanda Maximoff would have to be willing to do whatever it took to finally restore order to her reality… even if it meant unleashing a little chaos of her own…",

And of course at the moment he was seeking his revenge, which he thinks of as protecting Asgard from me, you would make your grand entrance, because even more than me, Hela, you love to be the center of attention.\" Loki spread his arms, taking in the situation. \"Where was I wrong?\"\n\"You betrayed Asgard to Hela?\" Rage nearly blinded Thor. Lightning crackled from Mjölnir, and from Thor's eyes, as the Odinforce rose within him. This was unforgivable treason — again! How many times had Loki done this, or tried to? And now, with the mortal Doctor Doom upending time and space, he was doing it again? \n\"Asgard was always destined to be mine,\" Loki said. \"The All-Father sleeps while the Realms are torn apart by scheming mortals. We do nothing as so-called Heroes blunder through their failed solutions to the problem. I intend to change that. But I cannot do that while you lumber around getting in the way. So.\" He gestured toward the portal. \nWhen Thor looked that way, he saw that the portal had enlarged a hundredfold, and the legions of the dead were upon him.\nThey came in seemingly endless waves, eyes empty and mouths open in snarls of mindless hate. Thor tore great swathes through them with Mjölnir, lightning breaking apart Hela's armies. Asgardians, Dark Elves, trolls of Jotunheim…the denizens of all the Ten Realms came together in Hela's legions, since death alone united every race connected to the World Tree. Thor fought them alone, while Hela and Loki watched, as if he was a gladiator whose life was their entertainment. He shattered them with Mjölnir, annihilated them with lightning, but cawing over Hela's legions were an endless flock of the Nastrond Crows, hellish creatures that Thor's blows could not destroy. They swooped and pecked and clawed, and no matter how Thor struck at them, they reformed from clouds of black feathers and came at him again. \nNo help was coming. Asgard was crippled by fear of Loki. The Valkyrior and the Crimson Hawks were away from the city fighting pointless wars in other realms, another maneuver by Loki to leave the city defenseless. All that stood between Asgard and Hela's legions was Thor himself. So be it, he thought. He would strike them down until he could no longer raise his arm. \nThat time was coming. He slew crows by the thousand and yet their numbers were undiminished. He was still the Odinson, god of thunder…but even gods grew old, and Thor felt the centuries in his bones as he shattered the lava-crusted skeleton of a Muspelheim fire demon and unleashed a blast of lightning that tore a great hole in Hela's ranks reaching across the plaza into the portal itself. If he could only close it…but no, he had not the magic. He would fight until he fell and earn his passage to Valhalla.\nThen, just as Thor had abandoned hope, Hela prolonged his misery. \"I tire of this game,\" she said. With a gesture she dispelled her armies. \nThe sudden silence in the plaza was jarring, broken only by the cawing of Hela's crows, who remained fluttering and squawking over the broad plaza before the Palace of Asgard. One alit on Hela's shoulder as Thor calmed his battle frenzy and turned to face her. If she wanted single combat, he would offer it, but he was tired and Hela's magic was mighty. He had no faith that he would survive, or that Loki would intervene on his behalf.",

Now Loki will.\" With a diabolical smile she added, \"And of course I will offer my own guidance.\"\n\"None of the Realms will survive if you destroy the balance among them,\" Thor said. \"You will bring Ragnarök.\"\n\"No,\" Hela said. \"The universes and the Realms are torn asunder and remade, doomed by those meddling mortals whose names for once speak true. The old ways, the old balances, they no longer apply. And you, Thor Odinson, are but a stumbling block, interfering with a new vision of the Ten Realms and beyond.\"\nThor flexed his arms to strike at her, but a powerful enchantment held him fast. Such was her power that he had not seen her make a motion or speak a spell. \n\"The old must make way for the new,\" Hela said. \"And sooner or later, everyone will make way for the dead.\"\nThor could see Loki just behind Hela, looking smug and completely in control as he created a portal from his newly tapped Chronovium. But how long before the trickster understood that Hela was playing her own tricks? The brothers locked eyes. Thor knew Loki could read his expression, even though he could not speak. This is not over, brother. I am coming for you, and when I do, no god or magic in the Ten Realms will save you.\n\"Goodbye, Odinson,\" Hela sneered, her dark power ensnaring him. And with a toss of her glorious hand, Thor was flung on a journey into mystery.\nHe fell from the sky trailing fire, and his impact left a ring of scorched ground a thousand feet across. When Thor stood, the echoes of his landing were still sounding in the dry hills that surrounded him. He was in a desert, with those hills receding in all directions under a sky that glowed an infernal red. He had never seen this place before. It was Midgard, certainly, but not the Earth he knew. Loki's sorcery had flung him very far from home indeed. \nThinking of his brother got Thor moving. Whatever Earth this was, he needed to find allies to accompany him back to Asgard and remove Loki from the throne before Loki's scheming backfired and Hela ruled all the Ten Realms.\nBut where to go…?\nOn the horizon he could see what might be a small city. Lights blazed around a tall tower. He would start there. \nThen he saw something rise up into the sky from near the tower. It grew rapidly, silhouetted against a red sun, and Thor realized it was moving.\nToward him. And very fast.\nHe had just gotten Mjölnir up in front of him when a giant came screaming down out of the sky, smashing Thor into the bottom of a new impact crater. Thor felt his power rebuilding within him, along with his battle fury. He released both in a blow from Mjölnir that knocked the giant back out of the crater. Thor leaped up after him, Mjölnir poised for another blow — and he saw his opponent was none other than the Hulk. But a different Hulk, crackling with vivid green energy and even bigger than the last time Thor had seen him, wearing a belt featuring various lights and devices. \"Banner!\" Thor cried out, dodging a swipe of Hulk's massive fist. \"What sorcery is this?\"\nHulk roared and smashed Thor into the ground again.\nVery well, Thor thought. He knew his one-time ally was prone to unthinking rages when in battle. Sometimes he had to be brought out of them another way. \nHulk's next punch met the head of Mjölnir, swung with all Thor's might. The blast wave from that collision knocked them both sprawling. Thor was up first. He leaped in a high arc over Hulk, coming down to deliver a mighty hammer blow to Hulk's belt. Gamma energy exploded out, searing Thor's eyes and knocking him flat. Dazed, he tried to get to his feet. When he could see again, the monstrous Hulk was gone and Banner sat in the shreds of his clothes and shattered pieces of his belt. \n\"Oh,\" he said. \"Thor.\" He rubbed his face as he stood, and his expression swiftly changed as he registered that it was actually Thor who stood before him. \"Thor! Do you know how long we've been looking for you?\"\nThor didn't know. He didn't know where they were or what Banner was talking about, and he didn't care. All that mattered was Asgard. \"Banner,\" he said, \"I need your help.\"",

The people in charge were calling it the Timestream Entanglement — a sudden disruption in the fabric of space and time that had sent chaos rippling across countless realities. The heroes of Earth had assembled to face the crisis head on. Not all of them had survived.   \n\n“...entire world is in a state of mourning for Steve Rogers, the beloved hero known as Captain America, who was struck down earlier this week when...”\n\n“About damn time,” a security officer in a Hydra uniform grunted, cracking a smile as he watched the satellite feed in the monitor station of the hidden Arctic base where he was stationed. \n\nThe officer switched the channel to see another news report discussing the theory that Victor von Doom, the ruler of the European nation of Latveria, was behind the Timestream Entanglement.  \n\n“Should’ve been us…” the security officer muttered, looking up at the large, red Hydra logo hanging proudly on the wall. He shook his head in disappointment. He had devoted his life to helping Hydra destabilize the world. And now, some Super Villain in a metal suit had beaten them to the punch. Still, he thought, there would surely be plenty of opportunities for Hydra to benefit from the world’s new status quo. And the top-secret experiments being performed on the lower levels of this base were merely the beginning of what was to come… \n\nThe officer stood and began his patrol, exiting the monitor station and walking across the hangar to an open bay door. He gazed wistfully out at the snow-swept landing apron beyond. \n\n“Another peaceful night on the edge of nowhere,” he said to himself. But he had no idea how soon his words would be proven wrong. \n\nWithout warning, a squad of soldiers clad in white Arctic combat gear emblazoned with Hydra’s red and black logo, came running toward the door. Before they could reach the safety of the hangar, they began to drop to the ground, one after another, each one with an arrow in their back.\n\nThe remaining soldiers turned, their weapons raised, as a hooded figure leapt through the snowy night sky toward them. The twin katanas in his hands flashed in the moonlight, shining brighter than the frost-covered landscape. \n\nIn a ballet of flashing steel, the mysterious assailant managed to wipe out the entire Hydra detachment, including the security officer. The first stage of his mission complete, the invader pulled down his hood to reveal the face beneath. It belonged to Clint Barton, the Avenger known as Hawkeye. \n\nAs he entered the Hydra base, stepping over the unconscious Hydra soldiers, he tried to get a sense of his surroundings as quickly as possible. There was no time to waste. Someone was waiting for him. \n\n“Hang in there, Bucky,” Hawkeye said. “The cavalry’s here.”\n\nSoon…\n\nAfter navigating his way into the depths of Mount Erebus, Hawkeye entered Hydra’s Super-Soldier Lab. Nine cylindrical glass tanks filled with fluid, each connected to a computer terminal via huge conduits, bubbled and glowed ominously. On the wall, screens cycled through human anatomical diagrams, energy equations, and images of decaying, mutated cells. \n\nHawkeye stepped closer to the glass tanks, his dual blades in hand, ready for anything. He surveyed the tubes one-by-one, finally stopping at the final tank, which had a label that read “CANARY”.\n\n“Jackpot,” he said with a grin. \n\nInside, partially concealed by the thick, glowing fluid, was the man that Hawkeye had been sent to retrieve. James “Bucky” Buchanan Barnes. The assassin known as the Winter Soldier. Before he could begin to set his friend free, though, a shadow unexpectedly passed behind one of the other tanks. Hawkeye looked in that direction, sword at the ready... He paused... \n\n…but nothing… \n\n“Hmm.” he muttered. “Nobody home.”\n\nHe began to sheathe the swords, returning his attention to the Winter Soldier’s tank... but instead he pivoted at the last second, parrying as an unseen figure nearly took his head off with a steel-gauntleted fist.\n\nA Hydra Super-Soldier emerged from the shadows. Seven-feet-tall, teeth bared, flesh twisted, madness in his eyes. He bellowed as he charged toward Hawkeye. \n\nHawkeye dodged and counterattacked, jamming one of his katana into a joint of the Super-Soldier’s mutated arm. Quickly realizing that his swords couldn’t penetrate the Super-Soldier’s dense flesh, Hawkeye changed tactics, trying to stay out of the Super-Soldier's reach and get enough space to use his weapon of choice: his bow and arrows. \n\nAs Hawkeye acrobatically bounded towards the other side of the lab, the Super-Soldier dislodged the katana jammed in his arm and threw it aside with tremendous force. The spinning blade shattered the glass of one of the holding tanks, sending glowing fluid splashing everywhere. The attached computer terminal began to short out in a shower of sparks.\n\nHawkeye was too busy surviving to notice that something in the shattered tank had begun to move. He finally got enough space to raise his bow and notch an arrow, but the Super-Soldier was already on top of him. Hawkeye had nowhere left to go...\n\nAs the Super-Soldier swung his enormous fist down toward the archer, a mass of tentacles entangled the brute’s arm. The startled Super-Soldier tried to struggle free, but the tentacles were too strong. With a sudden pull, the Super-Soldier was sent sailing through the air, smashing against the wall. Eldritch energy surged through his massive frame, and he slumped to the floor, a lifeless husk.\n\nHawkeye scanned the room for the source of the tentacles. He was thankful for the save, but not entirely sure that he was ready to discover what new horrors had been unleashed. \n\nThere, standing in the shattered tank, dripping with glowing fluid, stood the Winter Soldier. But something had changed about him. Where his cybernetic arm should have been was the same writhing mass of squid-like appendages that had just made quick work of Hydra’s experimental enforcer. \n\nHawkeye stared in astonishment, for once speechless. \n\n“You sure make a lot of noise,” the Winter Soldier said as he stepped out of the tank.\n\n“Didn’t mean to interrupt your nap,” Hawkeye retorted, doing his best to mask his shock and concern with humor. Lowering his bow, Hawkeye retrieved his katana from next to the shattered tank and sheathed it. \n\n“Come on,” he said, clearly uncomfortable as he put a hand on his old friend’s shoulder — the one without the mass of squirming limbs extending from it. “We’ll find a way to fix this. You’ll be okay. We just need to get you out of here.”\n\n“Not yet,” the Winter Soldier replied. “There’s something I have to do first.”\n\n“What we have to do is go back up to the landing platform,” Hawkeye said. \n\n“Gotta go down before we go up, Clint,” the Winter Soldier responded. “And I’m gonna need your help. Please.”\n\nHawkeye was taken aback. The Winter Soldier wasn’t one to say “please.” He could tell that this — whatever it was — was important to Bucky. It was enough to make Hawkeye push down his instinct to get the hell out of Hydra Town. \n\n“Well…” Hawkeye said with a sigh, “I guess if it was easy, anybody could do it…”\n\nHawkeye followed the Winter Soldier into a vast space, with lines of giant robot-like vehicles in various stages of construction. As they crossed an elevated catwalk that traversed the room, they heard shouting and the thudding of boot heels rapidly approaching. Hydra was on their trail. Wherever they were going, they would have to move fast. \n\nReaching a heavy door, they entered a chamber with a vaulted ceiling supported by pillars at least a hundred feet tall, each carved to look like a horrific monster. A portal yawned on one wall, with ancient energy radiating from it. Something was trying to come through from the other side… and even though Hawkeye could see it, his brain couldn’t process what the hell it was.  \n\nThe Winter Soldier approached an altar near the portal and climbed on top of it. Hawkeye followed reluctantly. The Winter Soldier extended his tentacles into the carvings on the altar, each one naturally sliding into the ancient stone grooves, as if they had been carved ages ago for this very moment. \n \nFragmented memories flooded the Winter Soldier’s already fractured mind. He relived the day he first infiltrated Hydra’s secret base, getting as far as the Hive chamber. He had tried to destroy it then, but failed. Hydra soldiers overwhelmed him and tore off his cybernetic arm. Before he knew what was happening, he was sealed inside a glass tank, tiny nubs of tentacles growing from his shoulder socket, his teeth bared in a permanent scream.\n\nSnapping back to reality, the Winter Soldier steeled himself, realizing what he had to do. Hawkeye glanced nervously from Bucky to the mass of Hydra soldiers that had just forced their way into the chamber.  \n\n“You’d better make this quick, Buck,” Hawkeye said.\n\n“Clint…” the Winter Soldier responded, gazing back at the portal behind him. Tentacles strangely similar to his own had begun to break through the membrane between realities. “How sharp are those swords of yours?”\n\n“Sharp enough to cut down an entire Hydra army,” Hawkeye said proudly. But his face dropped as he realized he had no idea what his friend was about to ask him to do. “Why?”\n\n“We have to close that portal,” the Winter Soldier said. “And let’s face it… I can’t exactly wear this thing to the next Avengers cookout anyway…”\n\nHawkeye glanced at the Winter Soldier’s bizarre new arm and took a deep breath. He had come here to save his friend, not to cause him more pain. But this was Bucky’s call… and it wasn’t like the guy hadn’t lost an arm before… \n\n“Fine,” Hawkeye said after a long pause. “Say when.”\n\nAs the creature emerging from the portal wrapped its tentacle around the Winter Soldier’s waist, the altar began to glow. It was almost as if a circuit had been completed, and the Winter Soldier was the conduit. Mystical power coursed between the altar and the portal, overloading Bucky’s body with energy and agony.\n\n“When!” the Winter Soldier screamed. \n\nWith a single clean slice, Hawkeye’s blade severed the entire bunch of tentacles just below Bucky’s shoulder, releasing a huge shockwave of energy, knocking both heroes and their Hydra pursuers to the ground.\n\nA rumble echoed through the chamber, deep cracks forming in the surrounding walls, pillars beginning to topple. Then, for a moment everything fell silent… until the portal surged with energy and the monster coming through it howled in pain, retreating back to the other side. \n\nWhen the dust cleared, Hawkeye and the Winter Soldier pulled themselves to their feet. With a quick survey of the room, reality set in. They had succeeded in stopping whatever was happening down here, but they had also cut off any escape routes in the process. \n\n“Guess you shouldn’t have come after me…” the Winter Soldier said. \n\n“Don’t say that,” Hawkeye replied. “I was just doing my job.”\n\n“You were a hell of a soldier, Clint…” Bucky said, ready to accept the inevitable as the pillars shifted and rubble began to rain down towards them. The chamber was about to collapse and Hawkeye and the Winter Soldier knew full well that this mission would be their last. \n\nSuddenly, the ancient portal began to glow again. Bucky and Clint braced for the worst, not knowing what horrors might come through it this time. But neither of them could have possibly prepared for what they saw next. \n\nA round, metallic object launched through the portal at tremendous speed, ricocheting through the chamber. Chunks of falling debris shattered into tiny pebbles that sprinkled down upon the heroes harmlessly.\n\n“What the —?!” the Winter Soldier gasped. He was completely shocked, but also moderately annoyed by the fact that, once again, this world wasn’t done with him quite yet. \n\nA figure burst forth from the mystical gateway, lunging forward and catching the metal disc in midair. He used it to effortlessly deflect a huge stone a split second before it could crush the bewildered heroes below. The stone didn’t even make a dent in his brightly polished red, white, and blue shield.\n\n“Bucky,” Captain America said, landing on the chamber floor and extending his hand to his former partner. “It’s been too long.” \n\nBoth Hawkeye and the Winter Soldier stared in awe, fighting through the pain and exhaustion to try and process what they were seeing. Wasn’t Cap supposed to be… dead…? \n\n“Sorry I missed your funeral, old timer…” the Winter Solider said.\n\n“Sorry I went to your funeral,” Hawkeye chimed in. “Clearly, you didn’t need one.”\n\n“I’m… not the Steve Rogers you knew…” Cap said, trying to find the words to explain. “It’s a long story. One even I don’t fully understand yet. And one that we unfortunately don’t have the time for at the moment. My friends in Wakanda were able to hijack and redirect this portal’s energy signature to open a gateway of their own, but there’s no guarantee how long they’ll be able to keep it open…” \n\nHawkeye and the Winter Soldier looked at each other and shrugged. This was far from the weirdest thing that had happened to them today. And they were willing to wait for the full story if it meant they could get out of Hydra’s house right now. \n\n“I was pretty sure we were gonna die down here,” Hawkeye said. \n\n“Wasn’t about to let that happen,” Cap said confidently. “Nobody gets left behind.”\n\n“Glad you’re not dead, Steve,” Bucky said, collapsing into Cap’s arms. “Umm… I think I’m gonna need a hand…”\n\n“Looks like you need more than that, Buck…” Cap said, looking at the oozing stumps on the Winter Soldier’s shoulder. \n\n“You know arms,” the Winter Soldier said, forcing a grin. “Easy come, easy go.”\n\n“Can’t say the same about partners,” Cap said back. \n\nThe Winter Soldier looked over at Hawkeye, nodding at the man who had rescued him. Hawkeye nodded back knowingly. \n\n“Couldn’t agree more…” the Winter Soldier said. \n\nMoments later, in a crackle of energy, the heroes stepped out of the portal. They weren’t anywhere near Hydra’s frozen base. That was instantly clear. In fact, it didn’t even look like they were on Earth anymore. The strange chronal energies of the Timestream Entanglement rippled across a star-filled sky as they gazed in disbelief at the spaceport of a futuristic city. If this was Wakanda, it certainly wasn’t the one that Bucky and Clint knew.\n \nAs the portal closed behind them, the heroes were greeted with a Wakandan salute from the Black Panther himself. Cap raised his hand to his forehead, offering a salute of his own. Hawkeye and the Winter Soldier remained silent and still, trying to assess their new situation.  \n\nShuri, the sister of the Black Panther and the brilliant mind behind some of Wakanda’s most impressive inventions, stepped forward and offered a box to the newly-arrived heroes. Clint took the container and held it with both hands as Bucky flipped open the lid with the one he had left. Inside was a cutting-edge cybernetic arm. \n\n“I was told you might need this,” Cap said, “so I called in a favor.” \n\nBucky picked up the arm with his good hand and snapped it into place. It was a perfect fit. \n\n“And now, I’m going to need a favor from you…” Cap said. \n\nThe Winter Soldier didn’t know what Captain America was about to ask him, but he wasn’t about to say no. Whatever came next, he would be there ‘til the end of the line. ",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10420000_HeroGalleryInfo_Story_#0_Content": "\"It sure would be easy to be sad,\" thought Peni Parker as she climbed out of the hot springs and got ready for her next patrol. She'd lost her parents, the world had been completely turned upside down because some guy named Doom had scrambled all of time, ruining the \"Web of Life and Destiny\" or whatever, and if that wasn't bad enough, she was in Tokyo and was set to miss every high school event in New York for the next forever. Seriously heavy stuff, but at least she would get to skip finals.\nShe'd also had a lot of time to put her Dad's SP//dr mech through its paces and work in his old lab. It wasn't easy letting herself be bitten by a radioactive spider, but Peni would have done it a hundred times over to be able to follow in her Dad's footsteps. Now, she is linked to SP//dr, fighting bad guys and protecting not just Tokyo, but the entirety of time and space! \nPlus there's this Chronovium stuff everywhere? What even is that? She knew people were after it, but what did it do exactly? She'd run some experiments that suggested it was, like, crystallized time, but that didn't explain much. Next time Peni took SP//dr in for maintenance and upgrades, she planned to spend a little more time figuring out exactly what Chronovium could do.\nLife was a lot better when you focused on the positive. She needed to remind herself of that from time to time, because she spent a lot of her time fighting a whole slew of weirdos from other timelines that probably didn't even know they were threatening the collapse of all of time and space. Or were they? Those details weren't always clear to Peni, but she loved hearing the Master Weaver and his apprentice, Spider-Zero, argue about it. And she knew that when push came to shove — as it often had since the Timestream Entanglement — she and SP//dr would defend the Web, even on mundane patrol missions like the one she was starting just now.\nThat meant defending both the Master Weaver and Spider-Zero, who were always so preoccupied with mending and weaving that they pretty much never noticed when they were about to be attacked. \nLike right now. \nA single Doombot angled toward the Nexus at the heart of the Web of Life and Destiny. The Master Weaver never noticed it. Peni did, though, and she had a plan. \"SP//dr, are you thinking what I'm thinking?\"\nSP//dr was. \nPeni tensed, and SP//dr leapt away from the Web strand she'd been sitting on, falling toward the Doombot. She had to time this just right, or it would be a long fall to the ground somewhere in Shinjuku. SP//dr might be able to handle the fall, but the shock of landing wouldn't do Peni any good. \nBut her timing, as it turned out, was perfect. The Doombot noticed her far too late, just as she had shot her own webs out from SP//dr's spinnerets and used a Web strand to snap her around in a long arc. The Doombot barely turned around when SP//dr slammed into it feet-first. Sparks shot from its chassis and bits of armor plating stuck to nearby stands of the Web as the Doombot tumbled away into the neon-speckled darkness below. \nPeni finished off the maneuver with a perfect, thruster-assisted double somersault that landed her on an upper strand of the Web, close enough to the Nexus where she could see both the Master Weaver and Spider-Zero. They were talking, and Peni didn't want to interrupt, so she hung upside down, just because, until Spider-Zero headed out onto one of the Web's strands, making little repairs as she went. Peni noticed Spider-Zero removing stuck bits of Doombot armor on her way, and felt a little guilty — but hey, she'd done what a hero had to do. Protect the Web!\nStill, did Doom — either Doom — ever run out of those things?\n\"I suspect not,\" a familiar voice said by her side, and Peni jumped. It was the Master Weaver.\n\"Hey,\" Peni said. \"Did you just read my mind?\"\n\"Not exactly. I sensed certain vibrations in the Web, and they suggested to me what you were thinking.\"\n\"Right.\" Peni said. \"Same diff. Hey, I've been meaning to ask you. I've been doing some experiments in my Dad's lab — my lab now — and Chronovium, wow, what is that stuff, anyway?\"\n\"Here, it has become part of the Web,\" the Master Weaver replied. \"But all things are ultimately part of the Web.\"\nWhich was a super Master Weaver-like thing to say, but didn't really bring a lot of clarity to the situation? \nBefore Peni could rephrase the question, the Master Weaver had passed on to another part of the Web. She decided to take the same question to Spider-Zero. \nAlso, she wanted to know if anybody knew when Doom was going to attack the Web himself. That seemed like a near-certainty, since there were just about always Doombots around, but nobody ever wanted to talk about it. Peni didn't know whether that was because they didn't know, or didn't want to tell her because she was a kid, or some other stupid reason, but she felt pretty strongly that Doom attacking the Web was a logical next step for him. Either of them. They had to be ready!\nAs she approached Spider-Zero, Peni was baffled to see the Weaver's apprentice doing something with...paper? At this distance it was hard to tell. She vaulted over onto another strand, then another, zigzagging until she got close enough to Spider-Zero that she could see Spider-Zero dropping little pieces of Chronovium into some of the portals that existed around the Nexus. The Chronovium in the Web was kind of sticky, and it looked like Spider-Zero was...yeah, she was writing something on pieces of paper and then sticking those pieces of paper to Chronovium?\n\"Hey!\" Peni called when she was close enough. \"What are you writing?\"\n\"A message to another version of myself,\" Spider-Zero said.\n\"How do you know where to find other versions of yourself?\"\n\"That's part of what the Master Weaver is teaching me,\" Spider-Zero said. \"I can listen in on an infinite number of other worlds and futures. Sometimes I can even...\" She made a conducting motion with both hands. \"Influence them a little.\"\n\"So you could do something about Doom? Or the Timestream Entanglement!\" Peni's thoughts drifted to maybe even saving her father, but she couldn't bring herself to say it. Was it even possible? And if he came back, would Peni just be a regular person again? It would be worth it.\nSpider-Zero was watching her, as if she could see the emotional tug-of-war going on inside Peni's mind. \"Well...possibly. But that is, if you'll forgive the expression, a very tangled web. Tugging on one strand will have all kinds of unpredictable effects. I wouldn't take any action until I've had more time to trace the path of each strand.\"\n\"How much time?\"\n\"Dunno, more than we've got with so much happening.\"\n\"Okay, so anyway, there are more Doombots climbing the Web to get you and the Master Weaver.\" Peni had just spotted them, jetting upward from the ground.\nSpider-Zero looked down. \"Uh huh,\" she said. She scribbled something on a piece of paper and stuck it to a bit of Chronovium. Then she pushed that through a tiny portal that opened briefly, like a soap bubble, by her hand. The minute she pushed the message through, the portal was gone. \nA split second after that, all three Doombots were gone too, swallowed up by a larger version of that portal that appeared around them and then blinked out of existence.\n\"Whoa,\" Peni said. \"That's definitely cooler than what I did.\"\n\"Oh, it's not a competition,\" Spider-Zero said. \"We all protect the Web in our own ways.\"\n\"Speaking of that,\" Peni said, \"you guys know that sooner or later Doom is going to get sick of sending Doombots and when he does, he'll show up to finish the job himself?\"\n\"Wouldn't surprise me,\" Spider-Zero said.\n\"So should we, like, maybe be doing something about it?\"\n\"What makes you think we aren't?\"\nPeni groaned. \"You sound more and more like the Weaver every day.\"\nSpider-Zero smiled. \"He's teaching me a lot. You too, I think. You've grown a lot since you started protecting the Web.\"\nThis had Peni feeling pretty good about herself until she looked up and saw Spider-Zero right there next to her. \"I have to repair that,\" Spider-Zero said, pointing at the dangling strands of the Web Peni had accidentally snapped while fighting the Doombot.\n\"I had to!\" Peni protested.\n\"I know,\" Spider-Zero said. \"I'm not angry. I just have to repair the Web. That's what I do. That's who I am. And without the Web —\"\nIt was Peni's turn to say, \"I know.\" After the Timestream Entanglement, the Web was more important than ever. It wasn't just the Dooms they had to worry about, but any other dimension-hopping villain or creature might appear at any moment to destroy the Web or the Weaver — or they might try to destroy Tokyo, or Japan, or the world, or all worlds! \nBut none of that was going to happen while Peni Parker was on patrol. That should be a banner, she thought: PENI PARKER ON PATROL! How cool would it be to have her own banner that followed her around, and maybe her own sound effects. A synthesized soundtrack! Even better. She started composing the tune in her head as SP//dr leapt and climbed among the endless strands of the Web. Soon enough, she had Spider-Zero back where she belonged. \nShe looked down on the city, then up at the vastness of the Web and the universes beyond it. \"I wish my father could have seen this.\"\n\"My father is also dead,\" Spider-Zero said, pausing for a moment in her work. \"But I think he would be proud of the work I do. Same for you.\"\nWell, that gave Peni a little twinkle in her heart. This hero business wasn't just about the fights. It could make you feel good sometimes too.",

    "HeroUIAssetBPTable_10430010_HeroGallerylnfo_Story_#0_Content": "If you had to crash, thought Peter Quill, might as well do it in the middle of maybe a thousand other spaceships. Makes it easier to find parts, at least. \nThat’s what Rocket was supposed to be doing, and maybe Groot too, but Quill wasn’t too sure about Groot. He had kind of wandered off in the direction of the jungle that bordered the ship graveyard. For all Quill knew, he was communing with the local daisies and dahlias.\nQuill hoped Groot wasn’t anywhere close to the fire spreading through the ship graveyard. The flames weren’t coming close to the Milano thankfully, which had churned up a good furrow of earth and scrap metal during its highly controlled and perfectly executed emergency landing. So, since he had pulled off a perfect landing after Rocket had screwed something up, Quill thought he should probably congratulate himself for making sure the Milano wasn’t going to be burned by creating an excellent firebreak behind it. Not that Rocket would ever give him credit, nor would Groot ever notice. \n“Man,” Quill said. “It’s not easy being a leader.”\nHe said this while sighting down the barrel of one Element Gun at an approaching symbiote. This was the downside of crashing in a spaceship graveyard on the planet Klyntar. Lots of symbiotes who showed up to the new crash site with an appetite. He was picking them off as fast as he could, but even Star-Lord could only take them down so fast, and more and more of them showed up with each passing second. Quill was starting to resent Rocket for crashing the ship in the first place. On the other hand, what good did that do? Now Rocket was looking for parts, which was the right thing to do if he wanted to make up for his mistake. Accountability, Quill believed, was a big part of successful teamwork. \nHe picked off a trio of symbiotes crawling over the top of a huge amalgam of Skrull ship parts just to the north of the Milano. He had seen some of these critters on Earth and elsewhere in the galaxy, but not like these. Apparently if they bonded to humans, they became sort of human? But these, hoo boy, they were bonded to all kinds of aliens that even Peter Quill, who had been to more planets than he’d had hot meals, could recognize. And none of them seemed to like humans very much, to judge from how they kept trying to claw or chomp or shred him. \nAn alert went off inside the Milano around him. Quill dropped into the ship just in time to catch a symbiote coming up through the hatch. He popped it with both Element Guns, but not before it had gotten all the way in and wrapped a barbed tentacle around his leg. Swearing in a every language he knew, he blew the tentacle apart and limped over to slam the hatch shut. His leg hurt like a flerkin’s kiss on the way back up to the top of the Milano’s hull, but pain had to wait. Quill was going to protect his ship to the end. \nA big explosion lit up the far end of the ship graveyard, over by a cluster of ancient buildings that rose up from the edge of the jungle. Looks like the fire’s reached a ship with something combustible on board, Quill thought. Bits of flaming wreckage rained down around the buildings and nearer to the edge of the jungle.\nMost of the symbiotes abandoned their siege of the Milano and took off toward the fire, which suited Quill just fine. It was a whole lot easier to fix a spaceship when you didn’t have a horde of monsters trying to eat you, or whatever they were trying to do. He shot at them a little more while they were running off, then tried to get a hold of Rocket on the comm. Interference responded, which could have been background radiation, or some weird emission from the massive Celestial corpse floating around in near-Klyntar orbit, or anything else, really. Rocket was incommunicado, and Groot, well, Quill never knew how to get in touch with Groot.\nGuess I’ll keep working until they came back, he thought as he watched the fire for a minute to see whether it was coming his way. When it wasn’t, he went below to see what he could do about getting this bucket of bolts back into orbit.\nA couple of hours later, he was putting the finishing touches on his work when he heard noises from a nearby wreck. He scrambled up to the top of the Milano’s hull and pointed Element Guns in that general direction — but instead of more symbiotes, he saw Rocket scrambling over the wrecked ships, with Groot right behind him. \n“Quill!” Rocket shouted. “Give us a hand!?” Groot was carrying a huge armload of scrap tech just behind the raccoon. \n“What, you took some time to go scavenging?” Quill asked. “What is all this garbage?”\n“It’s not garbage, you flarkin’ dolt,” Rocket said. “We fought like a hundred million of those monsters to get it, and now this scut is gonna get us out of here.”\n“Oh, I got that figured out already,” Quill said. “Everything’s all tuned up in the engines, except for —”\nRocket was already looking. “Except you don’t have any shielding over the plasma exchangers.”\nQuill pointed out at the wrecks. “Plenty of shielding out there, genius.”\n“And how were you going to get enough thrust to get us off-planet if you diverted all the power to the hyperspace drive?” Rocket put one hand over his eyes, dropping some of his various bits he collected. Quill was used to Rocket thinking he was dumb. It was part of their relationship now. But this time, he had an answer. He pointed up.\n“What?” Rocket demanded.\nQuill stabbed a finger toward the sky.\nRocket looked.\n“See that?” Quill prompted him. “The dead Celestial, orbiting up there?”\n“Yeah, I see it,” Rocket said. “So what?”\n“I am Groot,” Groot said.\n\n\n“That’s right,” Quill said. “A way out. Well, sort of. More like a… coordinate switcheroo. See, the reason I routed all the power to the hyperspace drive is that we can pair the Milano with the Celestial’s remains into the quantum whatever. The body will get trapped down here, the Milano goes up, then we hyperjump the flark out of here, and we never have to come back to this hellhole ever again!”\n“I am Groot?”\n“Meh, we can repair the regular thrusters whenever we get around to it.”\n“You’re kidding,” Rocket said. “Quantum swap with the corpse of a Celestial? That won’t work, you know how many conditions need to be—”\n“Not since we got that Nega-Energy Replicator from that doozy of a deal on Hala.  ‘Member how Mar-Vell and Rick Jones did it with the Nega-Bands? Take a look around!” Quill spread his arms. “Rocket, old pal, tell me what else we need that we can’t find here.” \nRocket was looking at Quill’s work again, this time with a more appraising eye. “Uh huh,” he said. “So you’re saying… you’re gonna build a temporary pocket of Negative Zone as a… terminal to stabilize the quantum displacement? Quill, you’ve had a lot of scuzzy ideas in our time, but this one’s actually…What was it that you Earth folks said— even a broken clock is correct once a day?”\n“Twice.”\n“Then it ain’t HALF bad.”\n“As compliments go, that’s pretty weak, but coming from you, I’ll take it. Plus, it has the added benefit of smashing the Celestial’s corpse down on these symbiotes, who I have to say are not so good with hospitality.”\n“I am Groot.” His massive companion dropped the junk in his arms and put a kind hand on his shoulder.\nQuill nodded at Groot, then shot Rocket a look. “Now that was a real compliment.”\n“Only problem is,” Rocket said, “if you don’t have some kind of force dampening matrix powered up when we swap, we’ll all get to orbit torn into pieces. But that’s totally cool, because I just so happen to have — by which I mean Groot just so happened to have dropped — a piece of equipment that will do the job.”\n“What?” Incredulous, Quill looked from Rocket to Groot and back. “How did you —?”\n“How did I know? I didn’t.” Rocket guffawed. “I totally got it for another reason, but it will work here.”\n“I am Groot,” Groot said.\n“You had help from a friendly vine?” Quill echoed. “Sorry, Groot, but that’s the most far-fetched thing I’ve heard since we got here. Nothing about this planet is friendly.”\n“I am Groot.”\nQuill turned to Rocket. “Seriously?”\n“I saw it,” Rocket said. “The native flora helped him. Groot’s a diplomat, if you didn’t know.”\nQuill chose not to process that idea at this moment, when a horde of symbiotes might show up again at any moment while they were trying to use the orbiting remains of a Celestial as a quantum anchor to swap themselves into orbit. \n“I…okay,” he said. “Groot’s a diplomat and you just happened to pick up the one piece of equipment I didn’t think of that’s going to save all our lives while I was busy holding off a hundred thousand million symbiotes to get our ship ready for its possibly final voyage.” Quill waited, hoping he sounded appropriately frustrated.\nBut either Rocket had missed the sarcasm, or just didn’t care, because all he said was, “Lucky, right? Here, let’s get it hooked up.”\nQuill sighed. For the second time that day, he was thinking about how hard it was to be a leader.\nWith an aligned goal, the remaining hard work went rather smoothly. Quill rushed back into the Milano as Rocket gave the new system a final check.\n“Time usually flies faster in the Negative Zone, but switching with our dance partner may take what feels like a while.”\n“Oh yeah, totally. And that second big button is here because…” Quill’s voice trailed off as his train of thought slowed.\n“To exit the Negative Zone from the other end, genius. One to get in, one to get out. Like those Nega-Bands. Unless you wanna stay there and watch the timestream collapse from that cosmic backwater.” Rocket rolled his eyes, then slapped on the first button.\nTHOOM!\nAlmost instantaneously, the Milano disappeared from the dark planet, leaving only a perfect shape of her landing pads and side-wings on the gooey surface.\nAnd just as fast as she disappeared, there she was, against the endless, pitch black of the Negative Zone…and the enormous body of the deceased ancient Celestial. Even with all they had seen across the galaxy, the crew felt they shouldn’t be looking upon the vibrant corpse, awestruck by the lifeless form of a god in front of their insignificant speck of a spaceship.\n“I am Groot…”\n“Say, this headless hunk and the big dome of Knowhere, ain’t they perfect for each other!” Rocket decided to light up the cockpit.\n“Uhh… do we know if decapitation kills these things? Cuz the Milano says it’s ALIVE!” A string of flashing readings on the interface lighted Quill like a ham in the microwave.\nAnd as if in response to him, the corpse made a single twitch.\n“I am Groot?!!!” Groot was unsettled.\n“No it didn’t! You’re seeing things. Besides, I’m sure it’s just the quantum swap having some residual effects, probably because it’s so big…yea…” Rocket’s feigned confidence waned.\n “And I don’t want to stick around long enough to find out.” Peter pressed. “Hit that second button, Rocket!”\n“Not yet. Havta recharge the engine!”\n“Just hit it! Something is happening over there!” Quill tried and failed to ignite the regular thruster out of desperation.\n“Quit it, Quill, or we’ll be stuck in the Negative Zone! There’s worse things here than whatever your imagination is thinking you saw!” \nAnd right on cue, the giant body started to shake violently, a wriggling mass forming within the husk of the Celestial..\n“I am Groot!” Groot pointed at corpse, panic in his three words.\n“Yes I believe you now! Yeah, yeah, something’s definitely moving on its chest. Those must be what the scanner picked up!” On the giant’s decayed chest plates, Groot and Rocket spotted a person-shaped symbiote, as well as a glowing cocoon of some sort.\nBut it didn’t stop Milano’s every single alarm from screaming.\n“That does it!” Quill leaned over and smashed on the first button. \n“No, Quill, you—”\nTHOOOM! \nThe ship was already back where they started before Rocket could finish, fitting squarely into the impression they left on the ground. \n“Aggh! You got any more bright ideas to waste our time?” Rocket seemed down.\n“I am Groot…” \n“All right, all right! As the captain, you have to make unpopular decisions sometimes. And we’re still alive, so you’re very welcome!” Quill stood up, looked around the cockpit. “Whoever that symbiote was, they’re not the same as the natives. And that golden egg thingy! If that’s who I think it is, they shouldn’t be there… but I think we’ve got some other friends around!”\n“Who cares?! C’mon, Groot. Let’s go find some more friendly vines. Maybe THEY can be a better captain of the ship.” Rocket headed to the hatch door. \n“You think so?! Then go ahead. When we’re back on Knowhere, I’m telling everyone that I saved our lives! Including those two up there!” Quill yelled to the back of his crewmates, but they didn’t stop.\n“Whatever!” Quill slapped the arm of his chair. Dude, being the leader is so hard, he thought.\nBut when he looked up to the sky, the Legendary Star-Lord smiled.\nThe giant corpse of the Celestial remained in the sky, with golden light shining from its chest. Like a light house in a raging black sea.",

    "UIHeroTable_10440_HeroBasic_RealName": "Eric Brooks",
    "UIHeroStoryTable_10440_Story_#0_Content": "Eric Brooks’s eyes opened for a moment, and he wasn’t sure if he was dreaming or not. But if this was just a dream, at least it was finally a good one after what seemed like an eternity of nightmares. And if it was really happening, well, it was almost too good to be true. There, in front of him, stood one of the members of the Fantastic Four, Reed Richards. And what Reed said next, Eric would never forget. \n“Dracula’s gone, Blade. You’re free now.” \nTo be fair, Blade knew he’d never truly be free. He’d been cursed since the moment he was born with a hunger that only a fellow vampire could understand. But if Reed was right, if Dracula had truly been defeated, then at least Blade could finally rest easy. And that was a good thing, because resting was about all that he had the strength to do these days. \n“Bout… damn time…” Blade whispered as his heavy eyelids shut once again. But the darkness he faded into soon gave way to a rapid series of images replaying the events that had brought him to this moment. \nHe didn’t know if it was days, weeks, or months ago, but it all began when Blade heard a terrifying rumor that Dracula was planning to take over New York City and transform it into his Empire of Eternal Night. As a vampire-human hybrid known as a Daywalker, Blade had devoted his entire life to bringing down the very worst members of his fanged “family”… and there were none worse than Dracula. \nBlade went on a secret mission, looking for leads about a mysterious ally who had been helping raise Dracula to this unexpected position of power. When his quest finally led him to New York, however, it wasn’t long before Blade became Dracula’s Most Wanted. Blade managed to carve his way through hundreds of undead soldiers, but he was no match for Dracula himself, whose powers had been enhanced by a crystal called Chronovium. Even with Spider-Man and the Human Torch backing him up, Blade was still overpowered when the vampiric villain transformed into a giant bat and dragged the Daywalker to his doom. \nSince that day, Blade had been kept in captivity, subjected to dark magic experiments and relentlessly drained of blood by Dracula. The lord of the vampires must’ve known that his Empire of Eternal Night wasn’t quite as “eternal” as the name suggested, so he was looking for ways to use Blade’s unique hybrid blood to turn all of his minions into Daywalkers in preparation for the time when the sun finally rose over the city once more. The process left Blade gravely wounded. He faded in and out of consciousness, only snapping back to reality when the pain was too much for his weakened body to bear. \nSo it wasn’t easy for Blade to know if Reed Richards was actually here to rescue him after all this time, or if it was just his mind playing tricks on him. After all, he figured he had lost his grip on reality quite a while ago, back when he started having deep conversations with a giant talking squirrel. \nBut when Blade felt his weary body being hoisted onto the Thing’s rocky shoulders, he knew that he was finally safe. And while he would have given anything to have been the one who drove a stake straight through Dracula’s black heart, he knew he had to focus on regaining his strength for whatever battle came next. Because, if he had learned anything over the years, it was that villains can die, but evil never does. \nAfter taking Blade back to the Baxter Building, Reed quickly realized that his friend’s wounds were far too severe for him to treat alone. Fortunately, he had allies in the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda who were far better suited to help Blade heal, body and soul. \nBlade was transported across the stars via one of Reed’s interdimensional bridges, arriving in the palace of King T’Challa and his sister, Shuri. There, it was hoped that he could safely rest and recover while his fellow heroes took on their next challenge — protecting a living island called Krakoa from an invasion by Ultron and his mechanical minions.\nWhile the heroes were busy fending off the android invasion, Shuri decided to try an unorthodox treatment to restore Blade’s health. She had developed an experimental serum that used an extract of Wakanda’s sacred Heart-Shaped Herb — the same precious plant that gave the Black Panther his uncanny abilities. As it turned out, T’Challa had become a quasi-king of the vampires after falling to Dracula, so Shuri was already working on a more readily accessible cure for him. She thought this serum might be the key to healing this unusual outsider as well, even though doing so defied almost every imperial tradition she was raised to respect. The Heart-Shaped Herb was usually reserved for the Black Panther alone… but desperate times called for desperate measures. \nAs soon as the serum passed his lips, Blade began to have visions far stranger than giant squirrels. In his comatose mind, he found himself walking through an endless field of purple, glowing Heart-Shaped Herbs. It instantly reminded him of the stories that T’Challa had told him about Djalia, the Wakandan ancestral plane. Suddenly, a strong gust of wind blew the leaves into the sky, where they formed a woman swirling with red and black energy, a spiral adorning her forehead. But a moment later, she morphed into an enormous likeness of Bast, Wakanda’s beloved Panther Goddess. Showing respect to his divine host, Eric knelt and offered his thanks to Bast. But the Panther Goddess did not return the kindness. Instead, Bast lunged forward and clawed at Blade. \nDeep inside, Blade could immediately feel what Bast was doing. She was not assaulting him, but rather his vampiric side. He had heard legends that the Heart-Shaped Herb could cure vampirism, but he had never been able to get his hands on any samples of the plant to see if there was truth to the story. But now, as this manifestation of Bast attempted to rip the infection from his body and devour it whole, he had reason to believe the rumors were true. \nAs much as he wanted to be free from his life-long curse, Blade refused to let go. He truly believed that he still needed his vampiric powers to help protect the world from those like Dracula who would attempt to spread their evil and harm innocents. If it meant he had to fight a Panther Goddess to remain a Daywalker, then that was exactly what he would do. \nBlade leapt out of the way of Bast’s razor-sharp claws, narrowly dodging the beast’s ferocious jaws as they snapped in his direction. He reached for the sword sheathed on his back, but found that nothing was there.  He quickly surmised that physical possessions must be unable to travel to this spiritual realm, which meant that the man called Blade was without the very weapon that gave him his name. As he scrambled to come up with a contingency plan on the fly, Eric let his guard down for a split second. That was enough for his feline foe to make her move. \nBast used the momentary distraction to strike a devastating blow, raking her claws across the Daywalker’s back. Blade howled in pain as he fell forward, landing on his hands and knees. The blood that poured from his wounds puddled on the fertile soil of the ancestral plane. For a moment, he wasn’t sure he’d be able to get back up… but then he saw a reflection of a familiar face in the crimson pool. It was the face of his mother. When his blood mixed with the soil of this sacred realm, could it have summoned her soul? Eric didn’t know for sure, but what he did know was that he had to keep fighting. For her. \nWhen the reflection of his mother held something out to him, Eric submerged his hand in the red liquid to grab ahold of it. He drew his hand back out and found a gleaming silver sword in his grip. Legend had it that Dracula’s cursed sword was an extension of the darkness in the vampire king’s soul. If that was true, then maybe this new weapon was a manifestation of the light in Eric’s. The parting gift from his mother.\nPulling himself back to his feet, Blade raised his sword, ready to rejoin the battle. Bast snarled at the Daywalker and prepared to pounce on her wounded prey.  \n“Almost had me there, kitty,” Blade said. “But you ain’t the only one with fangs… or claws…”\nLunging into the air, Blade struck the phantom Bast with his new sword, causing the Panther Goddess’ form to shatter into a million glowing leaves once again. As the leaves settled back to the ground, their brilliant purple hue faded to black. Blade watched as the leaves withered and died at his feet. He knew what this meant. Shuri’s treatment had failed. The Heart-Shaped Herb wouldn’t cure him, but thankfully, it also wouldn’t take away his birthright. He would remain a Daywalker… that is, if the day ever came where he could walk again… \nUntil then, Shuri would need to devote even more time and resources to healing Blade. And she wouldn’t have long until she would need to wake her sleeping champion, ready or not. There was a new enemy on the horizon: a darkness creeping its way across the galaxy, looking to snuff out every star — including the Vibranium one at the heart of the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. That was a fate Shuri could not allow. \nAs Shuri watched Eric peacefully slumber, she gently placed a long, tightly-sealed package next to his body. Reed Richards had delivered it at the same time he had brought Blade to Wakanda. At the time, Reed had simply said that it was a trophy, and that Blade would know what to do with it when he woke up. Little did Shuri realize that the Sword of Dracula was within the case, awaiting its new master. After all of the lives that this cursed sword had taken over the centuries, Reed believed that it was time for it to finally do some good in someone else’s hands. And there were few hands he trusted more than Eric’s.\nShuri stepped away, closing the door behind her in order to give Blade the chance to rest uninterrupted while she formulated a new plan. If she had stayed a moment longer, however, she might have seen a second sword with a shining silver blade start to materialize beside him. Though he was still in a deep slumber, Eric’s mouth curled into a faint smile, showing just the slightest glint of his fangs.",

One might think that those seemingly endless ocean depths would be far more than any single man could rule. But when that single man is Namor, the sovereign of seven seas, there is always room to expand the empire.\nWhile his throne sat in the kingdom of Talocan, it was Namor who united the various other undersea civilizations — from Atlantis to Lemuria — under his reign. Millions of sea-breathing soldiers and countless creatures of the deep all bowed in his presence and answered his every command. But still, Namor craved more. And he knew where to find it. \nMost of his people had only known a life beneath the waves, but Namor was a man of two worlds. True, it had been years since he had lived amongst the surface dwellers, but there was no denying that part of him yearned to feel the air in his lungs and the sun on his skin once more. But in order to do so, he would first have to deal with one of the greatest threats that the Earth had ever known: humankind itself. \nUnlike Namor's seafaring subjects, who lived in harmony with their undersea environment, the humans who lived on the land above had proven themselves to be a danger to the planet time and again. Their careless ways were poisoning the water that Namor's people breathed and threatening to bring the oceans themselves to a boil. Their own scientists had warned that it wouldn't be long before the seas began to rise. But if Namor had his way, the people who inhabited those seas would rise even sooner! \nFor years, Namor had been planning an all-out assault on the surface world in order to claim it as his own. Now, the time had finally come to act, before it was too late. Plans had been laid, and the first battle for control of the land was set to take place on a gem of the Pacific — Jeju Island. But even with his vast army at his back, Namor knew that there were those on the surface who would stand in his way and prevent him from seizing total dominion. Beings with great power who believed themselves to be the Earth's champions. \nIf he truly hoped to stand a chance against these arrogant air breathers, Namor knew he had to make a strategic alliance with a select few of them. Thus, Namor chose to accept the invitation of an old ally and decided to pay a visit to another island before setting foot on Jeju. As the drums of war reverberated through the cold depths, the king of the seas set his course for the island of Krakoa — home of the Mutants.\nGetting to Krakoa was not as easy as simply swimming to shore, though. The sentient island had recently been swept up in a chronal tempest and transported to a distant future. But thanks to the gift of a simple seed that he had planted in the silt at the bottom of the ocean, Namor was able to grow a gateway that delivered him across dimensional barriers and into the shallows off the Krakoan coastline. \nAs he emerged from the water, Namor found a group of emissaries awaiting his arrival. Amongst them were two respected Mutant leaders: the weather manipulator called Storm and the teleporting sorceress known as Magik. At the front of the group stood the man who had extended the invitation to Namor — the Mutant Master of Magnetism known as Magneto. \n\"I was not sure you would be coming,\" Magneto said, sweeping his cape aside with a regal motion as he gestured for Namor to come ashore. \n\"How could I resist such an exclusive form of travel?\" Namor replied. \"It is not every day that one can swim through a circle of kelp and arrive almost a century in the future.\" \n\"A journey few will ever have the chance to experience,\" mused Magneto. \"One reserved only for our people. For Mutants.\"\n\"I would think carefully before you choose to claim me as one of your own, old friend,\" Namor said.\n\"Krakoa does not lie,\" Magneto said, undeterred by Namor's warning. \"If you could cross through the gates, you are indeed one of us. Your genetics are unique — an anomaly compared to both races that spawned you. Like each and every one of us who calls Krakoa home, you are something more. Something superior.\"\n\"I have been telling people that for decades,\" Namor laughed. \"If only they had listened...\" \n\"I know that look in your eyes all too well, Namor,\" Magneto said, his stoic gaze revealing the slightest hint of concern. \"It is the look of a man who is about to make sure his foes start listening… by any means necessary…\"\n\"If you know me as you claim, then you are fully aware of my longstanding quarrel with humanity,\" Namor said. \"They have plundered the planet's resources and have polluted its splendor. They are a cancer that must be wiped from existence if my people are to survive.\"\n\"As we have established, we are your people as well,\" Storm chimed in, \"and we have always believed that peaceful coexistence is the key to survival.\"\n\"I am well aware of Charles Xavier's grand delusions,\" Namor said with a smirk. \"How are those dreams of his working out for you? Last I checked, isolating your entire race on a secluded island is certainly peaceful, but a far cry from coexistence.\"\nStorm's eyes began to crackle with lightning at Namor's insolent words. Without a moment's hesitation, Magneto stepped forward, strategically positioning himself between his most trusted ally and their distinguished guest.  \n\"We have forged a proud Mutant nation here on Krakoa\" Magneto calmly retorted. \"And while the humans still occasionally prove to be thorns in our sides, we have managed to build relationships with them that have proven to be mutually beneficial.\" \n\"For now,\" Namor said, \"until they find yet another justification for unleashing their killing machines upon your populace.\"\n\"If you're looking for a war,\" said Magik, extending the blade of her fabled Soulsword in Namor's direction, \"I happen to know a few in other dimensions that are worth fighting. There's no need to start one of your own.\"\n\"I did not start this conflict,\" Namor said, his eyes narrowing, \"but the king of the seas shall finish it, with or without your aid. So swears Namor!\"\nWith that, Namor turned and began to wade back into the shallows lapping at Krakoa's shore. But he stopped for a moment as Magneto offered one last thought. \n\"We respect your plight, Namor,\" Magneto said, \"and we will not stand idly by as your people are endangered. You are one of us, and Mutants take care of their own. Should you need us, we will stand by your side.\"\nNamor smiled. Perhaps a moment too soon. \n\"But be wary,\" Magneto continued. \"I have witnessed genocide firsthand and I will not allow it to be perpetrated again. Not even against the humans. And certainly not by one of our own. On Krakoa, we live by a simple rule: Murder no man. You would be wise to heed it…\"\nNamor and Magneto locked eyes for a tense moment. Then, the king of the seas dove back into the ocean without a word, swimming with tremendous speed back through the gateway that brought him to the isle of the Mutants.\nAs Namor sat on his throne pondering his next move, Magneto's warning echoed in his head, drowning out the cold silence of the ocean floor. It had already been clear that the impending battle against the humans would not be an easy one. Now, Namor would have to be even more cautious if he wished not to add another race of air breathers to his list of enemies. \nBut though Namor had always been many things — warrior and Mutant and king — cautious had never been one of them. \n\"Gather our greatest warriors,\" Namor said to his most trusted advisors. \"Summon the most ferocious beasts of the sea. Today, we bring humanity to its knees. Today, we claim Jeju Island in the name of Talocan. And tomorrow, if need be, Krakoa shall follow!\"",

Not quite a cocoon like my own — his was nearly as old as time itself — yet similar in many ways. The bearded man within was frail and weak, devoid of power. But he was not always so. As my mind was flooded with brief glimpses of his storied past, it became clear that he was once a mighty king that ruled a glorious realm for centuries on end. \n\"Time is something I have never feared,\" he said inside of my mind. \"Not until now. Time and space are twisting around us, and I am trapped here within the Odinsleep, unable to do a Bor-damned thing about it.\"\nThe Odinsleep? Of course! I knew the voice was familiar, even if the man himself no longer was. It belonged to the All-Father of Asgard, Mighty Odin. Had he fallen to the same forces that had caused me to reflexively retreat into my cocoon? \n\"Nay,\" Odin replied, reading my own thoughts, \"I was brought low by the machinations of my own son—the trickster known as Loki. The foul child has usurped the throne of Yggsgard and is set to destroy our proud legacy for his own selfish ends yet again.\" \nDid he say... Yggsgard? How curious. But the proper name of his realm was the least of my concerns. While the rage that the All-Father felt about his son's actions was palpable, there was something more beneath it. A deep concern that spanned far beyond the realm he once ruled. \n\"You too are preparing for a battle when you awaken, golden one,\" Odin said. \"And while my son may indeed test your mettle, he is naught but a distraction from your true enemy. There is a darkness in the cosmos, Adam — one far deeper than that of our slumbers. I have felt it trying to creep its way into my realm. Even into my own dreams. Should it be set loose, I fear that it will corrupt all it touches, snuffing out the stars themselves until nothing remains.\" \nWhat could he be speaking of? I called out to Odin for an answer, but his voice had muted to nothing more than a distant echo. As my cocoon drifted far past the embattled realm of Yggsgard, I left a small fraction of my soul's energy behind with the sleeping Odin — a hint of light to keep the darkness he spoke of at bay. I prayed it would be enough. \nNow that my cosmic awareness had been fully awakened, I could sense another empire on the horizon. This one was not nearly as ancient as Odin's realm, yet its own god seemed just as eager to call my name. \n\"Warlock,\" she said with a growl of disdain. \"You have come a long way to die.\"\nWas I being threatened merely for passing through this space? How rude. \n\"The Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda shall not harm you, traveler,\" the voice continued. \"But those beyond our borders will not be nearly as kind. Of that, you have Bast's word.\"\nBast. The panther goddess. A member of the Orisha, a pantheon of deities worshipped by the people of Wakanda. But last I recalled, Wakanda was merely a nation on the planet Earth, not an interstellar civilization. Could I have drifted into another reality? \n\"More precisely,\" Bast interrupted, \"other realities have drifted to you. This Timestream Entanglement has brought us together from across a multitude of planes. What is left of each universe is converging into one, as if we have been gathered...\"\nGathered? For what...?\n\"For the feast.\"\nAs Bast snarled her final words into my mind, it became clear that her divine presence had somehow been corrupted. Could she have been tainted by the very same darkness that Odin had warned me of? I had no way of knowing, as my journey across the spaceways had already continued deeper into the heart of this strange patchwork galaxy. \n\"Child of the light,\" a third voice suddenly echoed within me. \nThis one I could identify without hesitation. It spoke with such raw power that it could only belong to a Celestial — an ancient being spawned at the dawn of time. But yet, even though its words passed through my consciousness with tremendous force, they were softer than other Celestials I had encountered. Muted. Faded. Like distant memories. \n\"You would be wise to listen, lest my fate end up being yours as well,\" the Celestial implored, though I had little choice to give it anything less than my undivided attention. \n\"As you know, we Celestials were born at the beginning of all that is,\" it continued, \"but we were not the first. There was a primordial force that came before us. A creature of pure darkness, so powerful that he could strike down any who threatened to shed light upon the endless oblivion he ruled.\"\nEven the Celestials themselves? I struggled to imagine a foe so formidable... \n\"Few can wrap their minds around his nihility. And yet, here I am, slain by his sword, with nothing left of me but an empty husk and the echoes of consciousness.\"\nBut there was more than just the remains of a fallen Celestial in the void beyond my cocoon. I could sense that now. There was also a hint of corruption, not unlike the one that had tainted Bast. But this was not found in the disembodied mind of the slaughtered Celestial. Rather, it lingered on the great being's lifeless body, like an infected sore that had been festering for millennia. \n\"You feel him, too,\" the voice echoed. \"His tainted touch has stained my corpse for eons. But now, as time collapses around us, he has awoken once more, eager to revel in the oncoming oblivion. I have called out to others like you — great cosmic forces, ancient warriors, even the gods themselves — for help in containing his eternal blackness, but they have either retreated... or succumbed to his poison. Perhaps you will fare better... \"\nHoping the Celestial was right, I reached out with my mind, desperate to identify the source of this cosmic impurity. But my thoughts became clouded as I heard the Celestial scream a final warning. \n\"Beware, child of light! He has found you!\"\nWho? Who has found me? The Celestial did not answer. But another voice did, with a tone a thousand times darker than the blackness within my cocoon.\n\"Knull.\"\nAs he spoke his own name, I could feel his dark tendrils digging into my mind. This ruler of the void — this King in Black — had awakened somewhere, and was dragging me towards him. Try as I might, I could not escape his grip. \n\"Do not give up hope, child,\" the Celestial said, its voice rapidly fading. \"You will not be alone...\" \nSuddenly, a burst of cosmic fire erupted through the heavens, producing a flash so brilliant that it permeated the walls of my cocoon. The light lasted only a second, but its unusual shape forever burned itself into my mind — a majestic bird, its flaming wings spanning across the cosmos. Before I could process what had happened, the vessel that was meant to protect me now hurtled through space towards a destination unknown. \nMy body was still confined, but my mind was in a heightened state. Where there had once been blinding light, now darkness and despair had slithered their way in. I was overcome with images of the horrors that Knull had once committed, and those he had yet to unleash upon the universe. I could see his past and his future... but what of his present? That, it seemed, was shrouded in mystery — a void greater than Knull himself. \nSuddenly, my journey across the galaxy came to a violent end as my vessel made impact against a most unusual surface. Was this a planet? No... I could feel it writhing around me, as if it were alive. And more, I could feel Knull's sinister presence, closer than ever. Wherever I was, he was as well. \nBefore my cocoon could be dragged beneath the churning sea of oblivion surrounding it, a single crack appeared above me. Where before there was nothing, now there was the faintest glow. The faintest hope. I pushed through, emerging from my cocoon to gaze upon the surface of a world teeming with alien life. \nAnd as my mind touched their hivemind, it all became clear. This was Klyntar, the planet of the symbiotes. It was here that Knull was once worshipped as a god. It was here that his own followers imprisoned him eons ago. And it was here that he was biding his time, regaining his strength, in hopes to break free and claim his prize once more. \nPerhaps he had dragged me here to snuff out my light before it could drown out his shadows. But he made a grave miscalculation:\nI broke free first. And as I stood upon Knull's planet-sized prison, I made a solemn vow to do anything in my power to make sure that his infinite blackness would not go unchecked. \nIn the beginning, there was darkness. \nBut in the end, there will be light. \nAnd I shall be the one to help it shine.

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10470_Story_#1_Content": "“Klyntar, dead ahead,” Star-Lord said as his starship, The Milano, approached a somber black sphere hanging silently in the void of deep space. \n“You just had to say ‘dead,’ didn’t ya, Quill?” groaned Rocket. \n“Sorry,” Star-Lord said, powering down the ship’s thrusters as it entered the planet’s orbit. “But honestly, I may not be far off. We barely made it off this world alive last time we were here.” \n“Well, maybe if ya can manage not to crash our ship into this miserable ball of goop again —” Rocket said, beginning to take out his frustrations on the ship’s captain. \n“I am Groot,” Groot interrupted with a stern tone in his voice. \n“Yeah, I know,” Rocket relented. “It all worked out in the end. No use arguin’ about it now.” \n“Except it didn’t all work out, did it?” Star-Lord asked. “I mean, if it had, we wouldn’t have had to come back here again so soon, right?”\n“Probably shouldn’t have left in the first place,” Rocket said with a shrug. “Not until we knew Knull was actually a goner.” \n“We had no reason to believe he could have survived,” Mantis chimed in as she entered the ship’s bridge. “Even I couldn’t sense him after that explosion.” \n“Yeah,” Rocket mused. “If a genetic bomb built from the Divine Codex of a dead Celestial wasn’t enough to obliterate that jerk, I don’t know what is!” \n“MRRRR!” a tiny creature growled as it hopped up on the ship’s control panel to get a better view of the planet they were rapidly approaching. \n“Jeff suggests that he should have just swallowed Knull whole,” Mantis said, translating for her little friend. \nMantis had first encountered Jeff the Land Shark when they were both prisoners of an Elder of the Universe known as the Collector. After they managed to escape captivity in the Collector’s alien menagerie together, Jeff had accompanied Mantis when she reunited with her fellow Guardians of the Galaxy. From Yggsgard to Arakko, Jeff had proven himself a valuable ally in every battle since and had earned his place aboard The Milano. He took quickly to space travel, seeming to enjoy cruising through the stars almost as much as surfing through the seas. But as much as he faced every day with unbridled optimism, even Jeff couldn’t find much joy in the idea of returning to Klyntar. \nAs the ship prepared for landing, Jeff began to hum a peaceful tune in an attempt to calm himself. \n“MMMMM MMM MMMM MMM MMM MRRRR…” he crooned softly. \n“Ugh! Enough with all the singin’ already!” Rocket snarled. “I haven’t been able to get that flarkin’ tune outta my head for weeks!” \n“I am Groot,” Groot said encouragingly, gently petting Jeff on the back of the head. \n“I agree with the big guy,” Star-Lord said. “I think Jeff’s a great singer!”\n“I’ve heard what Quill calls music, Jeffy,” Rocket quipped. “I wouldn’t take that as a compliment.” \n“Music has been proven to have a soothing effect on countless species,” Mantis added. “If Jeff’s melodies help to keep him calm and focused in the battle to come, they may very well do the same for us.” \n“Makes sense to me,” Star-Lord said. “I’m still gonna bring my cassette player though, just in case…”\n“Well, you might as well hit play now, flyboy…” Rocket said as The Milano gently landed on Klyntar’s surface, “…’cause it’s go time!”\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy exited their ship and cautiously stepped onto Klyntar’s surface. Having been on this world quite recently, they knew the many dangers posed by the species of symbiotes that called it home. As soon as they exited the ship, Mantis clutched her head in pain. \n“Knull…” she said, her voice trembling, “…he’s grown stronger! I can feel his darkness… everywhere… ” \nRight on cue, several symbiotes slithered their way towards the Guardians at alarming speed. Rocket and Star-Lord both unloaded their blasters at the creatures, but the energy blasts went right through the symbiotes’ ever-shifting protoplasmic bodies without causing the creatures any harm.\n“They sure look a lot angrier than the last time we were here!” Rocket said. \n“And hungrier!” Star-Lord added as a symbiote launched itself through the air towards him, its sharp fangs glistening in the moonlight. \n“MRRRR!” Jeff exclaimed as he batted the symbiote away from Star-Lord with his powerful tail. \n“Get back on board the ship! NOW!” Star-Lord ordered… but it was too late. The horde of symbiotes had managed to get close enough to ensnare each of the Guardians in their amorphous tendrils. In a matter of moments, the heroes had been transformed from noble warriors to devoted servants of Knull. \n“Whoa. Why were we fighting this?” Star-Lord asked, examining the living costumes that had enveloped him and his teammates. They were now clad in black from head-to-toe, with crimson spirals on their foreheads — the mark of Knull. “We look totally hardcore!” \n“And all we gotta do to keep this kinda power is blast a bunch of lousy heroes in Knull’s name?” Rocket said. “Sounds like a sweet deal to me!” \n“We are Groot!” Groot agreed vehemently. \n“MRRRR…” Jeff grunted, not nearly as enthusiastic as his allies about their sudden turn to the dark side. The little land shark was doing everything he could to resist his symbiote’s control, but nothing seemed to be working. He could hear Knull speaking to him through the symbiote hivemind, compelling him to give in. But Jeff had never been the type to blindly obey. Instead, he doubled down, conjuring up images in his mind of all the people he had promised to fight for. Kate. Elsa. Gwen. Sai. Mantis. Seol. And, of course, his newest friends, the Guardians of the Galaxy. \n“MRRRRR!” Jeff yelped as he winced in pain. It was quickly becoming clear that happy thoughts alone wouldn’t be enough to fend off Knull’s attempts to assimilate Jeff into his symbiote army. But perhaps a happy tune would… \n“MMMMM… MMM… MMMM… MMM… MMM… MRRRR…” Jeff hummed slowly and methodically, trying to focus all his positive energy into the lilting melody. \nAll of a sudden, something completely unexpected happened. The symbiote that was trying to bond with Jeff began to hum the tune as well. At first, Jeff had assumed that the creature was evil, but then he remembered something that another of his allies, Venom, had told him during their adventure on Mars: Symbiotes each have their own personalities, just like people. Knull may be able to influence them to do his bidding, but he can’t change who they are at their core. \nJeff didn’t know much about the symbiote that had surrounded his body, but he could tell that his song was getting through to it. Its frenzied attempts to overtake Jeff’s mind had subsided, and now it seemed to be fighting back against Knull’s control instead. It was clear to Jeff that the symbiote was in great pain as it struggled to resist its creator’s commands, so Jeff did something that surprised even himself. He stopped fighting and let the symbiote complete the bonding process. \nJeff knew that accepting the symbiotic bond could very well turn him into a bloodthirsty monster, but there was also a small chance that it could create a unique partnership that strengthened both of them. And as a creature that always saw the best in every situation, Jeff was willing to take that risk. \nAs the connection between Jeff and his symbiote deepened, it gained full access to Jeff's memories. It could feel the peace of the warm ocean waves. It could see Jeff playing and dancing at the Hellfire Gala without a care in the world. And it could hear Jeff’s mesmerizing song growing louder and stronger. And suddenly, just like Jeff, the symbiote made the conscious choice to focus on the good in the universe, breaking free from Knull's control once and for all. \n“MRRRR!” Jeff exclaimed with renewed vigor as the bonding process finally finished. He and his symbiote were now in perfect harmony, and Jeff had never felt so strong before. And while he was certainly hungrier than ever as well, his desire to devour everyone in sight was finally in check. In its place was a desire to help everyone in sight instead — especially the Guardians. \nIf Jeff’s song could break his own symbiote free from Knull’s influence, there was a solid possibility that it could do the same for the symbiotes that had bonded with Jeff’s friends. Jeff swiftly swam across the planet’s surface until he found himself standing in the center of the assembled Guardians. He opened his jaws wide. \n“I knew it! That little freak’s gonna eat us!” Rocket yelled. “Knull says he’s gone rogue. We gotta take him out!” \nBut before the Guardians could begin their assault, Jeff sang out loud and proud.\n“MMMMM MMM MMMM MMM MMM MRRRR…” \n“That… that song…” Star-Lord said, shaking his head as if snapping out of a bad dream as his own symbiote pulled away. \n“So beautiful…” Mantis added as she began to sway to the hypnotic melody, returning to her green self more with each beat. \n“MMMMM MMM MMMM MMM MMM MRRRR…” \n“Y’know…” Rocket said. “It actually ain’t so bad after all…” \n“I… am… Groot…” Groot replied, coming back to his senses. \nAs Knull’s crimson spirals faded from the foreheads of his companions, Jeff grinned wider than he ever had before, with hundreds of teeth showing in his symbiotic smile. \n“You did a good job, my little friend,” Mantis said, reaching out to gently boop Jeff’s blunt nose. “I knew you would.” \n“So wait…” Rocket said, examining his paw, which was still covered in a thick layer of symbiotic slime, “…we get to keep these amped-up costumes, but we don’t have to follow Knull’s orders? That’s a way better deal!” \n“This might be the upper hand we need to put Knull down for good this time,” Star-Lord said. “And it’s all thanks to you, Jeff. When this battle is over, maybe it’s time to make you an official Guardian of the Galaxy. Whaddaya say?”\n“MRRRR!” Jeff chirped with glee as he leaped into the air and did a flip. He couldn’t have been more excited about what was to come. \n“Better keep that track on repeat, buddy,” Star-Lord said as more heroes began to arrive on Klyntar to join the impending war against Knull. “Looks like we’re not the only ones who are gonna need it.” \nJeff took a deep breath and prepared himself for the inevitable battle ahead. He knew it wouldn’t be easy — it never was. But he also knew that, with a little positivity and a happy tune, absolutely anything was possible!\n\n ",
    "UIHeroStoryTable_10470_Story_#0_Content": "As Jeff the Land Shark swam another lap around his small glass enclosure, frustration finally began to settle in. He had tried so hard to stay his usual optimistic self, even after he lost track of how long he had been held captive here inside this strange Theme Park created by the enigmatic Elder of the Universe known as the Collector.\nJeff didn't really know how he got here in the first place. One second, he was frolicking in the endless waves lapping at the California coast with his BFF Gwen. The next, he was here, trapped within a tiny tank that he couldn't seem to chomp his way out of, no matter how wide he opened his powerful, little jaws. \nBut since his unexpected arrival, Jeff had pieced together why he was here. Surrounding his own enclosure were countless other holding cells, each containing unique specimens of lifeforms he had never seen before. Some almost looked like the human friends he had made back home, but others were so bizarre and alien that they couldn't possibly have lived on the land or beneath the waves of his native world. Jeff had visited a zoo before with another of his friends, the archer called Kate. And now, he thought that he was probably in one — just another exhibit on display in an intergalactic menagerie on the edge of the known universe.\nJeff didn't love being confined in his tank, but he had taken some comfort in the fact that he wasn't here alone. And while none of the other creatures around him seemed to be fluent in landshark, there was one fellow captive whose thoughts Jeff could hear in his own head. She said her name was Mantis and that she was a friend. And if there's one thing that Jeff loved — other than devouring everything in his path — it was new friends!\nBut one thing that Jeff hated was when those friends were in trouble... which brings us back to why Jeff had suddenly lost his cheerful demeanor in the first place. Jeff had felt Mantis's psionic scream as she was removed from her cell and dragged away. He had heard the guards talking about taking her to some sort of arena where the Collector's prisoners were forced to fight for their lives against multi-dimensional variants of themselves. Jeff had no idea what any of that meant. But he did know that Mantis was in trouble. He couldn't hear her voice in his head anymore. He couldn't feel her calming presence. He couldn't see where she was or if she was safe. And that made Jeff mad!\nJeff began to swim frenzied circles in his tank, increasing his speed by swishing his tail and paddling his tiny legs as fast as he could. When he had built up enough momentum, he propelled himself toward the wall that separated him from freedom. But the only result was sharp pain as his sweet little face smooshed against the crystal clear wall. Not even the slightest chip or crack could be seen in the glass... though a few may have been left behind in his teeth. It was clear that Jeff would need another plan if he wanted to escape. \nAs he floated there, dazed from the impact, Jeff wondered what his friends back home would do if they were in his situation. Kate would probably use an explosive arrow. Gwen would find an unexpected way to break through a wall (probably the fourth one). Elsa would have hidden some ancient enchanted blade in her ponytail to slice through the impenetrable glass. And Wade would simply sweet talk the guards into letting him out, winning their favor with false promises of money and tacos. None of those options would work for Jeff. He was stuck here, and the thoughts of his lost friends — including Mantis — left him feeling more and more alone with every second that passed. \nBut then he sensed it. A familiar tingle in his brain. Mantis was alive! And she was coming back... for him! Jeff couldn't help but grin as his friend approached, flashing several rows of serrated teeth in her direction. This was the first time he had seen Mantis in person, but while he may not have known her face, he immediately recognized her mind. Now that mind was clearly focused on one thing only — escaping from captivity once and for all. \n\"MMMRRRRR!!!!\"\n\"He's going to draw the guards,\" another voice said. \nIn all his excitement, Jeff hadn't even noticed that Mantis was not alone. She had another humanoid with her, this one far more dark and brooding in demeanor. She did not look nearly as happy to see Jeff as Mantis did. And, to be honest, Jeff wasn't convinced that he liked her much either. \n\"Mrrr?\" Jeff grunted quizzically, noticing the way the second woman was looking at him. He felt as though she was sizing him up, preparing to strike him down the second there was no longer any glass between them. \n\"Don't mind her,\" Mantis said as she started to activate the release mechanism on the side of Jeff's enclosure. \"She wants to get out of here as badly as we do. And she knows the only way we can make that happen is if we work together.\" \nJeff smiled at Mantis, and she smiled back. Despite the fact that they were attempting to break out of the Collector's exhibition, with no real idea how to escape or where they would go if they did get free, there was something about this humanoid that made Jeff feel like everything was going to be all right. And it was clear he had the same effect on her. \nMantis continued to fiddle with the latch on Jeff's tank just as a squadron of armed guards came into view. As the guards shouted something in an alien language, Jeff could sense that Mantis was already reaching out with her mind in hopes of diverting them. But as quick as Mantis's thoughts were, somehow their new friend managed to get to the Collector's crew first. Her blades flashed in a glittering dance, and in seconds, the guards were down for the count. Jeff couldn't have been more impressed. \n\"Mrrr,\" Jeff said, trying to express his appreciation to the purple-haired warrior. Her cold gaze never softened. Jeff could sense that her mind was powerful, just like Mantis's, but her thoughts and emotions were heavily guarded. Jeff wanted his newest friend to like him as much as Mantis did, but for now he would simply have to accept that she no longer seemed to want to kill him or leave him behind. \nMantis finally managed to swing open the door of Jeff's tank, releasing a flood of water into the hallway. Jeff emerged from the miniature wave it created, propping himself up on his stubby legs and giving his body a quick shake to expel the excess moisture from his skin. Mantis laughed with pure delight as a deluge of droplets rained down on her. The other woman was not nearly as amused. \n\"Let's go,\" Mantis said, beckoning to her unlikely pair of partners. She began to run through the Collector's menagerie with a determination that made Jeff believe she knew where she was going. The warrior woman stayed close at Mantis's side, so Jeff felt the best thing to do was bound along right behind them.\nAs Mantis and her companion forged ahead, Jeff suddenly found himself distracted by an unusual smell. It was unlike anything he had ever encountered before, either on land or in the sea. It smelled delicious... and powerful...\nBefore he realized what he was doing, Jeff had veered off from his companions, entering the Collector's private gallery. Here, the Elder of the Universe had gathered some of the most powerful items and artifacts in all of existence and was displaying them for his wealthiest patrons to gaze upon. Jeff didn't know what any of these strange things were. Not the six colorful stones, nor the glowing cube, nor the otherworldly crimson gem, nor the flaming demonic scroll. But he did know one thing. He hadn't eaten in a very long time... \nJeff's instincts took control. He opened his tiny jaws wide and started to swallow down almost everything in the gallery as quickly as he could. Alarms began to blare, but it didn't stop Jeff from consuming one object of power after another! \n\"There you are, Jeff!\" Mantis cried as she and her mysterious ally entered the now-empty gallery. \"We thought we had lost you. Are you... okay...?\"\n\"Mrrr...URP!\" Jeff belched in response. His tiny tummy had started to rumble after he had gulped down a little metal vial marked PYM. \nAs Jeff blushed with embarrassment, Mantis chuckled. Even the steel-willed stranger couldn't help but smirk. But all levity instantly faded as another group of guards arrived in the gallery. \n\"Tivan is going to have our heads!\" one guard shouted, as he realized that all of the artifacts in the private gallery had somehow vanished. \n\"Not if we bring him theirs first,\" another guard responded, aiming his weapon directly at Mantis and pulling the trigger. \n\"MRRRRR!\" \nWithout a second of hesitation, Jeff leapt between the guard and Mantis, instinctively shielding his friend from the oncoming blast. But as he intercepted the attack, something extraordinary happened. Jeff grew to ten times his regular size! \n\"Hmm,\" mused the warrior woman. \"Must've been something he ate...\" \nThe enlarged Jeff let out a delighted squeal as he charged toward the guards, all of whom dropped their weapons and retreated as swiftly as possible. \nAs soon as they were in the clear, Jeff beckoned Mantis and her friend to follow him. \n\"That's not the right way, friend,\" Mantis said. \"We found the hangar. It's in the other direction. That hall will just lead you back to your cell.\" \n\"Mrrr,\" Jeff said confidently, fully aware of what he was doing. \n\"Oh, I see,\" Mantis said with a smile. \"Good boy, Jeff.\" \nThe women raced after the giant Jeff, back into the heart of the menagerie. \n\"Stand back, everyone,\" Mantis cried out directly into the minds of all the captive creatures. \nAs the alien assemblage took cover within their cells, the massive land shark gave a mighty twirl, swinging his tail with tremendous force and shattering through the outer glass walls of countless enclosures. The lifeforms once trapped within suddenly emerged from holding and scattered in all directions, each seeking their own way out of the Collector's custody. \n\"Mrrr?\" Jeff asked as he began to shrink back down to his normal size. \n\"I know, Jeff,\" Mantis responded. \"But we don't have time to save them all. At least not yet.\" \n\"Come on,\" their curious companion said, leading Jeff and Mantis through the chaos and back toward the hangar. \"This may be our only chance.\" \nTogether, they entered the hangar, and Mantis located a spacecraft similar to the one she had flown during her time with the Guardians of the Galaxy. Relief washed over her as she led her new teammates onto the ship and powered it up. \n\"We're finally free,\" the other woman said with relief. \"We can go home now...\" \nBut the stoic warrior paused. She didn't need Mantis's empathic abilities to sense the sadness radiating through Jeff's mind as he looked back toward the creatures rampaging through the Theme Park below them. \n\"And they will be free, too,\" Mantis said reassuringly, placing a hand on Jeff's smooth fin and giving it a gentle rub. \"We will find help and come back for them. We will free every single one of them. And we will make sure the Collector pays for what he has done. How does that sound, little one?\" \nAs the ship lifted off, Jeff responded as only he could. With a toothy grin and an emphatic:\n \"MMMRRRRRR!!!\"",

She had not wanted to leave so much destruction in her wake, but the stoic warrior knew all too well that, when Demons rise, sometimes there is no other option but to reduce the world to ash.\nFor months, the people in the small village at the base of Mount Shi’aru had been terrorized by a horde of insect-like Demons that skittered through their city at night, stealing away innocent villagers. An elder of the village had heard the tale of Sai’s triumph against Orochi and thought that, if anyone could bring these Demons to justice, it would be her. \nSai soon proved that she lived up to the legends, locating the hive of this strange insect brood in a cave at the top of the mountain. She sent in her faithful companion, the wolf named Logan, to lure them out. When the beasts emerged, Sai was waiting, psionic swords drawn and at the ready. \nAt first, she held her own against the creatures, dispatching them with sharp blades and bursts of psychic energy. But it wasn’t long before she found herself overwhelmed by the sheer number of Demons. They clambered up the trees around her, ready to strike from above with their poison-tipped tails. She had only one choice. \nReaching in her satchel, she pulled out a handful of fireworks given to her by a friend Juju. From another pouch on her belt, she removed a small piece of flint that she often used to light campfires during her travels. Sai set the fireworks on top of the flint and raised her sword high as the beasts descended upon her. With a powerful strike of her sword, the flint sparked and the fireworks ignited. Sai ducked for cover behind a thick tree trunk as the barrage of explosions erupted, sending blazing broodlings scattering in every direction. \nAs the mountain forest became a raging inferno, Sai entered the cave and found the queen of these strange Demons. It took every ounce of skill and training to avoid becoming the hideous creature’s next victim, but before long, Sai got close enough to plunge her psionic sword into the queen’s black heart. As she did, she could feel the searing pain of every insect connected to the Demons’ hivemind. It overloaded Sai’s senses, leaving her on the brink of collapse as she staggered back out of the cave. \nLogan came to her aid once again, dragging Sai just beyond the border of the burning forest and licking her wounds until she regained her strength and her senses. It had been a brutal battle, but it was yet another Sai had won. The fewer Demons in the world, the better. \nShe reached beside her and gently scratched the head of her loyal companion. Logan had stayed by her side through so many encounters — against Yokai and Oni of all shapes and sizes. Without ever opening her mouth, Sai whispered straight into Logan’s mind. \n“Good boy,” she said. “Now, come. We have a prize to claim…” \nSai pulled her round sedge hat up onto her head, covering her purple hair, as she began to walk away from the flaming trees and back toward the village at the base of the Mount Shi’aru. As they got closer to the village, Logan sniffed at the air frantically and began to growl. \n“What’s the matter, friend?” Sai asked. But mere moments later, she had her answer. A strange doorway opened directly in front of her, as if out of thin air, and a mysterious figure was about to cross through from the other side. \nSai went to reach for her sword, but before she could draw the blade, she felt a pain surge through her body unlike any she had ever experienced before. It was as if she had been hit by Hulkmaru himself!\n“Perhaps the Demons have finally gotten their revenge,” she thought to herself. “It was only a matter of time…”\nLogan howled as everything faded black. \nNow. \n“What’s on your mind?” Mantis asked Sai. \nSai knew full well that the strange woman named Mantis had mental abilities similar to her own. She could have easily read Sai’s mind if she had wished. However, Mantis genuinely seemed to want to respect her new friend’s boundaries. Sai appreciated that.  \n“Where I came from,” said Sai, “and where we are going.” \nMuch time had passed since that fateful day on Mount Shi’aru. More time than Sai cared to remember. When she awoke, she had found herself trapped inside of a heavily reinforced enclosure, part of a display in a strange alien menagerie. Its benefactor, an Elder of the Universe known as the Collector, had gathered countless species from across space and time so that his patrons could stare at rare and deadly creatures from the safety of the other side of the glass. \nSai wanted nothing more than to be free. To find her way back home to her own world. To Logan. And she would finally have her chance when her fellow captive, Mantis, staged an escape attempt. Along with Mantis and another strange creature — an unusually cute, quadrupedal shark named Jeff — Sai fought her way through the Collector’s Theme Park to a vessel that was able to sail through the stars. She had no idea where she was now or how to get back home, but at least she was free of her captor’s clutches… or so she thought… \n“MRRRRR!” Jeff shouted as he ran into the cockpit of the vessel and nudged Mantis with his blunt nose. \n“What is it, Jeff?” Mantis asked as Jeff turned and darted toward the back of the ship again. \n“I think he wants us to follow him,” Sai said, as she started to realize how much Jeff reminded her of Logan. \nJeff led Sai and Mantis to the rear of the spacecraft and jumped up on a console so that he could see out of a large viewport. He started motioning frantically with one of his front feet, pointing out of the window. \n“I don’t see anything,” Sai said as she gazed into the dark void of space. There was nothing behind them but darkness and a bit of debris.  \n“I don’t think it’s what he saw…” Mantis said, her hand placed against her temple and closing her eyes. “It’s what he felt. Someone is following us.” \nSai took a moment to focus her mind and she felt it, too. Then she heard it inside of her head: The chatter of alien voices growing ever closer. She did not understand how anything could soar through space, but if she and her companions had managed to do it so easily, perhaps others could do the same without being detected.  \nJust then, a massive ship materialized behind them, ten times larger than the small craft they had stolen. On its hull was the same marking that Sai had seen throughout the theme park that she had just escaped. The crest of the Collector. \nMantis raced back to the ship’s cockpit and grabbed hold of the throttle with one hand. With the other, she began frantically pressing buttons. Jeff mewed with excitement. \n“I learned this trick from Peter Quill,” Mantis said, as their tiny ship lunged forward, reaching its top speed in nanoseconds. “Don’t tell him I stole it.”\n“I do not even know who that is,” Sai reminded Mantis. \n“Well, I hope you get to meet him,” Mantis said, “if we manage to survive this.” \nMantis pushed their small vessel beyond its limits, but the Collector’s battleship somehow managed to keep up with its pace. Pulling sharply on the ship’s yoke, Mantis diverted the craft into a belt of floating debris, narrowly dodging giant rocks — and the scrap from other ships that weren’t fortunate enough to have such a deft navigator at their helm. \nEmerging on the other side of the asteroid field, Sai was caught off guard by what she saw ahead of them. Not the Collector’s battleship, but something nearly as large. And it was alive. \n“Yokai,” Sai whispered under her breath as she studied the enormous whale-like creature floating in front of them. \n“No…” Mantis replied. “Acanti.” \nMantis touched Sai’s shoulder, and the warrior’s mind was flooded with images of spectacular space whales, traveling in pods and singing rapturous songs that echoed through the cosmos. Mantis had clearly encountered these majestic creatures before during her travels with the Guardians of the Galaxy, and now she was sharing all of her experiences with Sai via telepathy. \nBut this lone Acanti was nothing like the ones in Mantis’s mind. It did not sing in joy, but rather, it wailed in pain. Even Jeff could hardly bear to hear the beast’s mournful cries. \nMantis reached out to the Acanti with her powers, letting it know that she was a friend of its kind… and that she was in danger. She begged the creature for its help, and promised to return the favor in any way she could. The Acanti seemed to understand, opening its massive maw and allowing the tiny ship to fly inside. \nAs they took safe harbor inside the mouth of the Acanti, Sai felt something strangely familiar. A skittering sensation in the back of her mind. Something she hadn’t felt since her time on Mount Shi’aru. \n“I know what is ailing this creature,” Sai said. \n“Really?” Mantis asked. “What could possibly bring an Acanti so much sorrow?” \n“Demons,” Sai replied.\t\nThis time it was Sai who opened her mind’s eye for Mantis to peer into. Mantis caught glimpses of Sai’s epic battle against the insect-like monsters in her home reality, their teeth gnashing as they clawed and slashed at the seasoned warrior. \n“Those aren’t Demons,” Mantis said, recognizing the images in her friend’s mind. “They’re aliens. A nasty race of parasites that call themselves the Brood.” \n“Well, they picked one hell of a cave to make their home,” Sai mused as she looked out of the craft at the interior of the Acanti’s cavernous gullet.\nMantis grabbed a breathing mask from off the wall of the ship and placed it over her face. She handed others to both Sai and Jeff. \n“The Brood are a particularly vicious race,” Mantis said as she walked toward the ship’s airlock. “How did you defeat them in your world?”\n“With fire,” Sai said. “But that’s not an option here.” \n“Agreed,” Mantis said. “Even if we did have oxygen to burn, I highly doubt the Acanti would be thrilled if we set its insides ablaze.”\n“MRRRR…?” Jeff gurgled hopefully as he followed his two humanoid companions off the ship and into the Acanti’s craw.\n“No, Jeff,” Mantis said, “I’m sorry to say it, but I don’t think we can just ‘talk it out’ with the Brood.” \n“Perhaps we can,” Sai said. “The last time I encountered these creatures, I was able to momentarily connect with their hivemind.” \n“I see where you’re going with this,” Mantis said. “But we’d need to find the Brood Queen if we want this to work.” \n“MRRRR!” Jeff said, racing down the Acanti’s tongue and off into the distance. Mantis and Sai looked at each other and shrugged before turning to chase after their finned friend. \nAs they traveled further into the dark depths of the Acanti’s throat, the three heroes found themselves facing off against an ever-increasing number of Brood hatchlings. Sai swung her swords with keen precision. Jeff gnashed his teeth and swung his tail. And Mantis fought barehanded with a fury that her companions had not yet witnessed. One after another, the alien parasites fell, but more always seemed to take their place. \n“No wonder the Acanti was in so much distress,” Mantis thought, loud enough for her companions to hear. \nFinally, they reached the Acanti’s stomach, where they found the Brood Queen waiting. While Mantis and Jeff fended off more hatchlings, Sai dodged and weaved through the aggressive alien army as she made her way toward their mighty mistress. When she arrived, she readied a blade of pure psionic energy. Instead of piercing the Brood Queen’s heart, like she had done on Mount Shi’aru, she plunged the psychic sword straight into her mind. There was something Sai wanted the Queen to see. No. To feel.\nWith her free hand, Sai touched the inner wall of the Acanti’s stomach. Acting as a conduit between the creatures, she transferred the Acanti’s pain and sorrow into the Brood Queen’s insect brain, sending waves of raw emotion rippling across the alien hivemind. It was too much for the malignant monarch and her minions to handle. \nThe remaining Brood spread their wings and took flight, following their Queen back up the Acanti’s throat. The Acanti opened its jaws just wide enough for the Brood to make their escape into the void outside. The massive beast let out a triumphant cry that echoed through its insides as its unwanted guests finally disappeared into deep space.\nAfter the battle, Mantis communed with the Acanti, asking it to provide them a safe ride back to the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. The colossal creature gladly obliged, as a way of showing thanks for ridding it of its parasite problem. Along the way, Jeff even gave the Acanti a nice, thorough dental cleaning as a sign of mutual respect. \nBefore they could reach Wakandan space, however, Mantis intercepted a distress call from her fellow Guardians of the Galaxy — Star-Lord, Rocket, and Groot. Their ship had crashed on an alien world called Klyntar, home to a species almost as parasitic as the Brood. Mantis knew where she had to go next, and it wasn’t Wakanda. \nSai and Jeff were prepared to join Mantis on the next leg of her journey when Sai suddenly heard a new cry echoing in her head. A powerful voice unlike any she had ever heard before. Strange… but so familiar… It uttered four simple words: \n“To me, my X-Men.”\t\nThough she did not know what the words meant, she knew that she would have no choice but to answer the call. As images of a living island on the other side of the universe filled her mind, Sai could feel in her soul that this mysterious place was home to others just like her… and it might finally be the key to getting her back home again.\nJeff nuzzled up against Sai’s leg and let out a gentle purr. She had not expected to grow fond of this strange little creature, but battle did have a way of making strange allies. She reached down and gently rubbed her hand along the rubbery skin on top of Jeff’s head. \n“Good boy,” she said, whispering directly into his mind. “Now, come with me. It’s time we finally find the freedom we deserve…” ",

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10490_Story_#0_Content": "“Another one, Freddie. Heavy on the orchid nectar.” \n“You got it, Logan,” said Fred Dukes, the bartender of the Green Lagoon — a secluded watering hole nestled into the heart of Krakoa, the living island that served as a safe haven for Mutants from across time and space. \nThe massive man plucked a beautiful tropical flower from a tiny garden behind the bar. He squeezed it in his oversized hand, causing the strange pink liquid contained within its delicate blossom to trickle into a tall glass. Mixing in a few other natural ingredients, he covered the glass and gave it a quick shake before sliding it across the bar to his most loyal customer. \n“Not used to you ordering off the organic menu,” Fred said with a smile, noting that Logan’s tastes usually tended to be a bit more traditional. \n“Yeah, well, I didn’t come here to forget anythin’ tonight, bub,” Logan said, gazing at the nectar swirling in his glass. “For once, I wanna remember every detail.” \n“And I would like to hear them as well,” a voice said as another man approached the bar. “If you are willing to share, my friend…” \nLogan looked up from his drink to see one of the greatest foes he’d ever faced, the Mutant Master of Magnetism known as Magneto, taking a seat next to him. If this were a few years ago, Logan would have already popped his razor sharp Adamantium claws and taken the first swing… but these were strange times. And for a man who’d lived a life as long and eventful as the Wolverine, that was certainly saying something. \nLogan was used to the unexpected, but everything had turned upside down when the chronal disruption known as the Timestream Entanglement started wiping out realities. Krakoa may have been home to some of the most powerful Mutants on the planet, but that still wasn’t enough to keep it safe from the cosmic catastrophe’s devastating effects. The island and its inhabitants found themselves swept up in a powerful temporal storm and nearly became lost in time and space. Ororo Munroe, the X-Man called Storm, managed to navigate the island safely through the tempest, but when the danger had finally passed, their new reality began to sink in. Krakoa had not only been transported to a different dimension, but to a whole new era as well — the year 2099. \nAlways one to seize an opportunity, Magneto took advantage of the crisis. But not in the way most might’ve expected. Instead of trying to subjugate the unsuspecting humans of this future world, he instead opened the gates of Krakoa to all Mutants who had become displaced by the Timestream Entanglement. His efforts had already earned him the respect of many… and the ire of many more. Magneto didn’t care what the world beyond Krakoa thought of him, nor did he have any interest in mankind’s petty squabbles. All he cared about was the safety of his own people and of Krakoa. But Logan knew that no man — or Mutant — was truly an island. \n“Still got your cape in a bunch that I’ve been runnin’ with the humans, Erik?” Logan asked, taking a swig of his drink and sneering as the festive, fruity flavors danced across his tongue. \n“There are still so many Mutants who need our help, Logan,” Magneto responded. “You should be focused on them.”\n“Our people ain’t the only ones in trouble,” Logan responded gruffly. “Just ‘cause most folks in this day and age don’t seem to be born with the X-gene anymore, it don’t mean we can just ignore the threats they’re up against.” \n“Helping innocents is one thing,” Magneto said, his tone becoming more judgmental. “But you’re out there fighting the powers-that-be alongside some sort of… human liberation front? Your careless actions could put a target on Krakoa and all those who came here for protection.” \n“Funny,” Logan said, dismissing Magneto’s concern, “since when have you been one to stand by and do nothin’?”\n“Since the well-being of our entire species became mine to safeguard,” Magneto replied.\n“Fair enough,” Logan said. “But believe it or not, I’m doin’ what I do to keep Krakoa safe as well. From goose-steppers like the Public Eye. From corporations like Alchemax. And especially from that metal-masked maniac, Doom.” \nMagneto paused, knowing his companion was speaking the truth. Somehow, Victor von Doom was still alive and thriving in this era. The king of Latveria had become more powerful than ever, both as a political leader and as a sorcerer. It was even rumored that Doom himself had kickstarted the Timestream Entanglement, though there were conflicting reports as to whether it had been the Doom of this reality or another of his Multiversal variants. Still, Magneto knew it was only a matter of time before Doom set his sights on Krakoa and the growing army of Mutant soldiers for whom it had become a sanctuary. Perhaps Logan’s actions were more justified than Magneto was willing to admit… \n“Your allies in this Resistance…” Magneto said, considering his words carefully, so as not to send the Wolverine into a berserker rage, “…are you sure they can be trusted?”\n“With my life,” Logan said without pause. “There may not be many of us fightin’ this fight, but the ones we’ve got are the best there are at what they do.” \n“And the hottest, am I right?” Fred chimed in unexpectedly from behind the bar. “That Black Widow was always smokin’! For a human, I mean… But then again, I guess she’s gotta be, what, like, over a hundred by now? So maybe just forget I said that…” \n“Natasha don’t look a day older than she did when she was in her prime,” Logan responded. “Guess I ain’t the only own who figured out how to fight off the effects of agin’. And there’s someone else who just showed up that literally hasn’t aged a day in a century and a half… Someone you probably oughta know about, Erik… ”  \nMagneto (and Fred) listened intently as Logan began to recount his most recent excursion beyond the shores of Krakoa. \nLogan had left through a Krakoan gate to rendezvous with Natasha Romanoff in Tokyo. The Red Room, which the Black Widow was now using as her own personal spy network, had intercepted rumors that someone was planning hits on major crime organizations, including the Yashida Corporation. They needed to know if the person targeting these groups was a potential ally or yet another enemy to add to their list. But when Wolverine arrived at their usual meeting point, Natasha was nowhere to be found. He tried to contact her on the Resistance’s secure comm channel, but she had gone radio silent. That wasn’t like her. \nAfter a digging for intel and making a few minor threats, Logan learned that Natasha had gotten a credible lead about an ultra-top-secret “MERCURY” level asset being stored at Alchemax’s Tokyo HQ. Whatever it was, she must’ve realized that her window to recover it was extremely short if she was willing to risk going in without backup. \nLogan raced through the back alleys of Tokyo toward the Alchemax tower, but he wasn’t fast enough. Before he could reach his destination, a powerful explosion lit up the night and shook the city’s streets. Worried about Natasha’s safety, Logan doubled his pace, but instead of finding the Resistance’s most elite spy, he instead found himself face-to-face with one of the most legendary warriors to ever grace the field of battle. Steve Rogers.\n“Captain freakin’ America?!” Fred blurted out, snapping Logan out of his story. “You gotta be kiddin’ me!”\n“No joke, bub,” Logan said. “But the boy scout wasn’t alone.” \nLogan continued his tale, saying how Cap’s signature red, white, and blue uniform was badly scorched, as if he had just walked out of the inferno at the Alchemax building. To make matters worse, he was now surrounded by a small squadron of Doombots that were all aiming their weapons at him. \nLogan wasted no time, popping his claws and leaping into the fray. As he furiously slashed, reducing Doombots to scrap, Logan never once questioned if he was on the right side of the battle. After all, if there was anyone who could be trusted without hesitation, no matter the timeline, it was Captain America.\nCap didn’t have his shield on him, but that didn’t stop him from joining the fight. The Super-Soldier was one of the best hand-to-hand combatants who’d ever lived, and even a seasoned warrior like Logan couldn’t help but be impressed by Cap’s strength and skill as he delivered blow after blow to the mechanical menaces. \nOnce Wolverine had sliced the head clean off the final Doombot’s armored shoulders, he asked Cap about Natasha. Cap confirmed that she was the one who had rescued him and said that she was safe. Logan warned that she wouldn’t stay that way if they stuck around much longer. Cap agreed, noting that he had only just been unthawed in this strange new world, and he already had Alchemax, the Public Eye, and now Doom himself looking to get their hands on him. \nLogan considered bringing Cap back to Krakoa, but there were multiple problems with that plan. First, the organic gateways that allowed Krakoan citizens to travel to-and-from the island in the blink of an eye could only be accessed by those with Mutant genetic signatures. Second, as much as he hated to admit it, Logan knew deep down that Magneto was right. If their foes found out that Cap was being harbored by the Mutants on Krakoa, it would almost certainly drag all of Mutantkind into a war that none of them were ready to fight. At least not yet. \n“A wise choice,” Magneto said. “But where is your star-spangled ally now…?” \n“I’m gettin’ there, pal,” Logan said. “Hold yer horses…” \nLogan went on, telling how he took Cap back to a secure Resistance safe house. By then, the effects of the blast at Alchemax — not to mention the century and a half that Cap had spent trapped in ice — had taken their toll on the Sentinel of Liberty. Not even his Super-Soldier Serum was enough to heal his burns and reduce the atrophy in his muscles. \nCap didn’t have had a healing factor, but Logan had access to something that could get his new ally back in the game again in no time. Making a quick trip back to Krakoa, Logan gathered some medicinal flowers and returned with them to safe house. It wasn’t long before Cap was back to his old self. His renewed vigor had apparently also renewed his sense of duty. \n“I owe you my life, soldier,” Cap said upon his recovery. “This may not be the war that I was made to fight in, but I’d be honored to join your Resistance and help you turn the tide against this Doom fella — and any other fascist forces trying to crush your people beneath their collective boot heel.”\n“Thanks for the offer,” Logan said, “but that mess back at Alchemax has probably set off Public Eye alarms across Tokyo… and beyond. The Resistance is gonna need to keep a low profile for a while. And as great as having Captain America on our team might sound, it’s bound to draw a bit too much unwanted attention.” \n“I understand,” Cap replied. “Do you happen to know anywhere else I can go? Preferably somewhere far enough away to keep everyone safe?” \n“There aren’t many places left on this planet that aren’t under constant surveillance,” Logan replied. But that notion gave him another idea. What if the place he sent Cap wasn’t on this planet at all? \n“Tell me, bub…” Logan continued, “…you ever hear of Wakanda?” \n“The African nation?” Cap asked, instantly seeing the merit in Logan’s suggestion. “They managed to hide their presence perfectly during the war. I doubt anyone would be able to find me there. And the good news is, I happen to be close friends with King T’Chaka. My shield was even forged from Vibranium, a rare Wakandan metal! I wonder if they could make me a new one…”\n“Hate to break it to ya…” Logan said with a smile, “… but T’Chaka ain’t the king anymore. And Wakanda is a long way from Africa these days…”\nLogan informed Cap of how the Wakandans had set off to the stars in search of the true source of Vibranium and had since built themselves an intergalactic empire. Cap seemed dismayed, but all hope wasn’t lost. The current king of Wakanda, T’Challa, had been attempting to make strategic alliances to battle against a darkness he saw on the horizon. \n“Ah, yes,” Magneto interjected. “T’Challa came to me seeking Krakoa’s aid… but we were not yet ready to commit to such a partnership.”\n“Yeah, well, he came to Natasha, too,” Logan said. “And she was smart enough to take him up on his offer.” \nT’Challa had provided the Resistance with a single high-tech Kimoyo bead containing special code that could be used at any Wakandan Embassy to open a passageway across the stars, straight to the heart of the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. \nWith Natasha still off the grid after the Alchemax incident, it was up to Logan to escort Cap to the Wakandan Embassy in Tokyo. As much as Logan would’ve loved to carve a path through some Public Eye soldiers along the way, the two heroes managed to use their impressive stealth skills to get to their final destination undetected. \nWhen they arrived, the Embassy was empty. The two followed T’Challa’s direction and located the sculpture of Bashenga, the first King of Wakanda. As they stood in front of the statue, Logan activated the Kimoyo bead, and a portal instantly appeared. Cap gave Logan a salute, thanked him for his service, and stepped through, confident that he could handle whatever awaited him on the other side. \nWith Cap safely delivered, Logan knew he had to return his attention to finding Natasha… \n“…but not before stoppin’ back home for a quick refresher,” Logan concluded, finishing off the last drops of pink liquid in his glass and wiping his stubble-covered chin with his forearm. \n“A fascinating tale,” Magneto said. “But what I find truly refreshing is the notion that, perhaps, we have as many friends in this new world as we do foes.”\n“Sometimes it helps to take yer helmet off so you can see the full picture,” Logan said with a smirk. \n“Indeed,” Magneto replied, as he stood to walk away. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I have much to do… and, it seems, much to consider…”\n“You and me both,” Logan said as he placed his empty glass on the bar. \n“Want me to fill you up?” Fred asked, hoping that another round might come with another exciting story about Logan’s adventures. \nLogan stood up and glanced down the trail that led out of the Green Lagoon. He knew he had to get back into the field sooner rather than later. Natasha was counting on him. And he had a feeling that it wouldn’t be long before he crossed paths with Captain America again. \n“Sure, bub…” Logan said, reaching back and pulling his cowl up to cover his eyes. “…but you’d better make this one for the road.” \n\n\n\n",
    "UIHeroStoryTable_10490_Story_#1_Content": "“RRRRRAAAARGGGHHH!”\nThe Mutant known as Wolverine let out a primal scream as his razor-sharp Adamantium claws sliced through yet another of Ultron’s robotic drone soldiers. \n“Easy, Logan,” Magik said to her fellow X-Man. “If we’re going to win this battle and save Krakoa, we need your head in the game. Not just your claws.”\n“Thanks for the reminder, snowflake,” Logan said as he took a deep breath. Pulling himself back from the edge of a berserker rage, the cloud of red obscuring Logan’s vision began to fade. He was once again able to survey the battle taking place around him with a clear mind. And despite the devastation sweeping across the nation he called home, he liked some of what he saw.\nMagik had already returned to the battle, using her giant Soulsword to cut multiple androids in half with a single stroke. Around her, a horde of demons — Magik’s loyal subjects from Limbo, the netherworld in which she reigned — stood at the entrance of a Krakoan gateway, eviscerating any mechanical invader that dared to pass through to the living island. Logan had been fond of Magik ever since she was just a little girl, but seeing the strong and fearless warrior that this version of her had grown into filled him with a sense of pride that he rarely felt.\nNearby, another Mutant warrior was skillfully fending off Ultron’s forces with her psychic blade, but this one was only vaguely familiar to Logan. True, he and Psylocke had fought side-by-side for many years as members of the X-Men, but this woman — who simply referred to herself as Sai — was a version of Psylocke from another timeline who had only recently arrived on Krakoa. And unlike the alternate Magik, this Psylocke was vastly different from the one Logan knew. Even so, she defended her new home as if it had always been her own, which is all that Logan could ask for. And her pet wolf, who happened to share both Logan’s name and his ferocity, wasn’t so bad to have around either. \nLogan heard a noise coming from the shoreline and turned to see a small army of sea creatures emerging from the churning waves. The aquatic beasts blasted the bots with bolts of seawater. A massive monster even shot an enormous laser, obliterating an entire squadron of Ultron’s drones. Namor, the king of the seas, stepped up next to Logan and smiled proudly. \n“You Mutants are lucky to have me on your side,” Namor said. “Ultron’s toys are no match for the monsters of the deep.” \n“I sure hope you’re right, fish breath,” Logan said, as yet another battalion of robotic drones blasted its way through an unguarded Krakoan gate, “cuz we’ve got more uninvited guests!” \nAs Logan ran directly into the new wave of android assailants, he held his arms out to his sides so that his fully extended claws could slash their way through every hunk of scrap unfortunate enough to pass him by. The drones fell to the ground in pieces around him. \n“About time I started getting the security I paid for,” a voice said inside of Logan’s head. It belonged to the Mutant telepath Emma Frost. \nEmma had been the one who had planned tonight’s extravagant Hellfire Gala on the island of Krakoa. She had invited countless Super Heroes and powerful world leaders to dine, dance, and determine the future of relations between man and Mutantkind. But things went terribly wrong when the genocidal robot called Ultron returned to Earth and crashed the party. What started as an evening of fun and festivities had since devolved into chaos and all-out war. \n“If you wanted a bouncer, Emma, you shoulda hired the Blob,” Logan snapped back in his mind. “I can’t control who comes through the gates. I can just cut ‘em to pieces once they do.” \n“I simply imagined that you and the little X-Force you assembled —” Emma continued. \n“This ain’t no X-Force, lady,” Logan barked, stopping Emma mid-thought. “Magik, Sai, Namor… They’re all tough as nails, sure. But despite the matchin’ costumes, we ain’t never fought as a team before. And it shows.”\n“Indeed it does…” Emma’s said as her thoughts began to trail away. Logan knew that she meant no harm, but even so, he was glad to finally have her out of his mind. He had more important things to focus on. \nWolverine raced over to where Magik and Namor were standing. Both Magik’s demons and Namor’s sea creatures were doing their best to block off any new reinforcements from coming through the Krakoan gates. But for every portal they managed to secure, another seemed to open, as if Ultron had somehow gained full access to Krakoa’s network of interspatial gateways. \n“We’ve gotta shut these blasted doors down,” Logan said. “We can’t let any more of these things in.” \n“The only problem with that plan,” Magik replied, “is that no one else would be able to get out either. Including all the innocent people who were attending the Hellfire Gala.” \n“I know of very few air breathers whom I would consider ‘innocent people’…” Namor said with indifference. “Besides, I thought you Mutants put the safety and sanctity of Krakoa before all else.” \n“Not before helpin’ others,” Logan replied. “Even if the folks we’re tryin’ to save are the very same kinda humans who would send an army of Sentinels to wipe out our entire nation if they had the —”  \nLogan paused for a second, realizing that what he just said might hold the key to their dilemma. \n“Sentinels,” he muttered under his breath. “That’s it!” \nFor years, humanity had attempted to exterminate Logan’s people by building massive Mutant-hunting robots known as Sentinels. At first, they were easy to defeat with just a few slashes from Logan’s claws. But with every new generation, the Sentinels’ defenses had been improved upon. Still, there was one thing that always succeeded in taking down these mechanical menaces — an electromagnetic pulse.\n“Anyone seen Magneto?” Logan asked. \n“Last I heard, Ultron took him out,” Magik said. “I would check the Arbor Magna. He should almost be resurrected by now.”\n“Ain’t got time to wait,” Logan scowled, rushing off toward the jungle at the heart of Krakoa. “Gonna have to go to my back-up plan.”\n“Where do you think you’re going?” Namor demanded. \n“To end this fight once and for all, bub,” Logan yelled back, never breaking his stride. “Hold the fort ‘til I get back, eh?” \nLogan raced as fast as he could to the entrance of a secluded cave. Stepping inside, he found himself in the Armory — the secret workshop of the X-Men’s resident inventor, Forge. Unfortunately, Forge wasn’t currently home… but Logan could smell that he wasn’t alone… \n“You don’t belong here,” Logan growled at the intruder. \n“Funny,” Rocket replied, stepping out from the shadows clad in a massive hat and flowery shirt, “I thought you Mutants were supposed to be all about coexistence.”\n“I am Groot,” his tree-like companion added as the shiny little Warwolf called Amazing Baby nibbled on his stray branches. \nLogan snatched a strange, high-tech device out of Rocket’s paws. \n“This ain’t your tech, runt,” Logan said. “You got no idea what you’re dealin’ with here.”\n“True,” Rocket mused, “this stuff is all pretty advanced by Terran standards. But to me, it’s as outdated as Quill’s stupid music player. My work is lightyears ahead of this!”\n“Then maybe you can help me,” Logan said, suddenly realizing that having a self-proclaimed tech genius like Rocket on his side might be exactly the advantage he needed. “If we want to take down Ultron once and for all, we need somethin’ powerful. Like —“ \n“An electromagnetic pulse grenade?” Rocket asked with a smirk.  \n“Yeah,” Logan said. “One of those.” \n“Whaddaya think you’re holdin’, pal?” Rocket said, pointing a tiny finger at the device that Logan had snatched from him earlier. \n“I am Groot,” Groot added. \n“You tell him, big guy,” Rocket laughed. \n“So… if we set this thing off, Ultron’s done for?” Logan asked as he examined the device. \n“In theory,” Rocket replied. “But there’s a catch. Alla’ the other tech across the island goes down, too. That means fancy suits of armor, bionic limbs, and any top-secret gizmos you might be hidin’ in caves like this one.”\n“Cerebro…” Logan whispered, realizing that the pulse would also potentially take out the one piece of technology that Mutantkind valued the most. Cerebro was used to store the genetic data and memory profiles of every Mutant on Krakoa, making it the key to their Resurrection Protocols. If the EMP destroyed Cerebro, it would take the future of Logan’s people with it. \n“Did you say ‘Cerebro’?” Rocket asked, raising a bushy eyebrow. “Me and Groot heard Ultron jabberin’ about that thing… whatever it is. Said he was gonna claim it for himself.” \n“Over my dead body,” Logan snarled. He took the EMP grenade and rushed towards the exit of the Armory.\n“Hey! Get back here with my flarkin’ pulse bomb!” Rocket yelled. \n“I am Groot,” Groot said with disappointment as Logan disappeared back into the Krakoan jungle. \n“I know, right?” Rocket responded with frustration. “I did all the work and that walkin’ can opener is gonna get the credit! Story of my life…” \nLogan wasn’t concerned about who got recognition for ending this fight. All he wanted was for it to be over before Ultron could do any more damage. And now that Ultron had his sights set on Cerebro, Logan knew he had no other choice. He couldn’t allow the sensitive data stored on Cerebro to fall into Ultron’s hands. He would rather destroy the device than let Ultron pose a greater threat to Krakoa and all of Mutantkind.\nUsing his heightened senses, Logan hunted the original Ultron through the Krakoan jungle. There was something different about his smell that set him apart from all of his robotic duplicates that had flooded the island. It was almost as if this Ultron was made from a different metal… but it was one Logan’s nose couldn’t quite place… \nHacking his way through the dense undergrowth, Logan finally emerged just outside of the Pointe. Ultron was already there, attempting to blast his way into the Cradle — the location of the primary Cerebro unit. Logan had arrived without a moment to spare. \n“You will not stop me from completing my new directive,” Ultron said as he turned and fired a laser beam at Logan. “Cerebro will be mine.”\n“Take it,” Logan said. “It ain’t gonna do ya any good when you’re both lyin’ in the scrap heap!” \nDodging a barrage of lasers, Logan tossed the EMP grenade at Ultron. A split-second later, an enormous burst of electromagnetic energy released from the tiny bomb. Logan’s body was sent hurling backwards by the blast. It felt as if his bones were about to be torn out of his body. But he could handle the pain if it meant that Ultron was shut off for good. \nFor a moment, a hush fell over Krakoa. But then, an unexpected voice broke the silence. \n“A valiant attempt,” Ultron said, hovering over to look down at the disoriented Logan. “But my body was forged of Mysterium alloy. Electrical conductivity simply charges me. And it seems your dear Cerebro is still on-line as well, thanks to the vines of Krakoa that kept it grounded. \n“Nnnn… nnoooo…” Wolverine groaned. \n“It seems that all you managed to do was to wipe out a few of my soldiers…” Ultron continued, “…and nearly all of the weapons belonging to your fellow heroes. I really should thank you for the assist…”\nUltron released a massive burst of energy at Logan, burning most of the flesh off his Adamantium skeleton in an instant. Logan roared in pain as he was roasted alive. \n“…but I have worlds to conquer.” \nLogan laid helpless on the Krakoan soil, only able to watch from a distance as Ultron entered the Cradle to claim Cerebro. As his healing factor finally started to kick in, Wolverine vowed that he would finish the job he had started in the only way guaranteed to take Ultron out of service permanently. \nWith his bare claws.",

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10530_Story_#0_Content": "The Grove. Up until recently, this secluded location deep in the heart of the living island known as Krakoa had regularly been filled with the chatter of Mutant leaders heatedly debating the future of their nation and their people. But when the Timestream Entanglement ripped Krakoa from its original timeline and displaced it into the far future, many of Mutantkind’s most prominent voices ended up scattered across the ages. The hush that fell over the Grove in the days that followed was thicker than the island’s humid tropical air. But as the Mutants who still called Krakoa their home had come to learn so many times before, nothing lasts forever… \n“The Quiet Council of Krakoa now summons forth the White Queen of the Hellfire Trading Company,” Magneto’s powerful voice boomed, cutting through the silence of the Grove like a sword. \n“And so begins the trial of Emma Frost…” the White Queen sighed, stepping forward out of the shadows. Her diamond skin glistened through the countless strategically-placed openings in her fashionable ensemble. \n“No need for drama, Emma,” Storm said, taking her seat at the Quiet Council’s Table of Summer. “You know full well that we have gathered here tonight on your behest to consider your proposal.” \n“And what an impressive turn out…” Emma mused sarcastically, looking at the empty seats in front of her. \nWhere once there had been twelve members of the Quiet Council, now only three remained. Storm, Magneto, and Emma herself. And while Emma was convinced that her idea was truly a brilliant one, this time her vote would not be counted. She would have to convince the other two members of the Quiet Council to side with her, and she knew far better than to use her natural-born telepathic abilities in an effort to sway their opinions. \nLuckily, for Emma Frost, persuasion was an art form. Long before she became a crusader for Mutant rights, she had used her skills of seduction and negotiation to rise through the ranks of the Hellfire Club, making her one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in the world. She had learned through experience that there was always a way to get what she wanted. And this night would be no different. \n“As you know, the Hellfire Gala —” Emma began, before being abruptly cut off by Magneto. \n“— is a waste of our time,” the Master of Magnetism finished. “Krakoa is in crisis, Ms. Frost. We have been transported across time and space to an unfamiliar era that seems keen on reminding Mutantkind of just how unwelcome we are in the world of man. We have lost so many of our brethren, tossed to the corners of unknown realities. And yet, you wish to spend our resources to throw one of your garish parties? I think not.”  \n“First,” Emma replied, choosing her words carefully as she responded to Mutantkind’s current leader, “my parties are anything but garish, darling. They are the height of extravagance.” \nEmma wasn’t lying. Ever since she first revived the historic Hellfire Gala as an annual event on Krakoa, this no-expenses-spared celebration had become the hottest ticket on the planet. From super heroes to political heavyweights, if you didn’t make it onto the guest list, then you simply weren’t living up to your full potential. Emma had curated every aspect of past Galas — from the food to the fashion — but the plans for her next event had been put on pause after Krakoa’s unexpected change of address in space-time. Now was her chance to change that. \n“Second,” she continued, “the Gala is our opportunity to show this new world that Mutants are here and we are not going anywhere. A debut ball, of sorts.” \n“I believe Wolverine has already made everyone well aware of our presence,” Magneto said, the frustration in his voice quite evident. \n“Logan was just doing what he thought was right,” Storm interjected. “He meant no harm.”\n“But Magneto is correct,” Emma admitted. “When Wolverine decided to ally himself with the human Resistance, he got caught up in a series of events that cast all eyes on Krakoa in a less-than-favorable way. His little stunt at Alchemax may have saved Captain America’s life, but it branded Logan an outlaw according to the Public Eye and made him an enemy of both Doom and the Mega-Corps that control all aspects of this society. And though they were the actions of just one Mutant, all of our reputations were damaged in the process.”\n“That’s a bit harsh…” Storm responded, desperate to defend one of her closest allies in the eyes of the Council, “…but you’re not wrong. What Logan did was reckless.” \n“Reckless, perhaps,” Emma agreed, “but even the most ill-advised strategies often open up unexpected pathways to victory.” \n“Alchemax has launched countless lawsuits against Krakoa and has imposed unprecedented sanctions,” Magneto argued. “Tell me, woman… how does that lead us to a victory?” \n“We have something that Alchemax does not,” Emma replied. “Medicines that actually work. As you both know, our Flowers of Krakoa have been proven to work miracles in fighting both human and Mutant diseases. They yield ten times the results of Alchemax’s best performing medications, with none of the nasty side effects. And now, the entire world has full access to them. Just take a look at the report in front of you…” \n“It says here that the Hellfire Trading Company has just signed independent deals with over seventy nations to distribute our biopharmaceuticals,” Storm said, shocked by what she was reading. \n“And that number will only grow once word gets out about how safe and effective the Flowers of Krakoa actually are,” Emma responded.\n“You’ve directly targeted a sector that accounts for sixty percent of Alchemax's business,” Magneto said, his temper beginning to flare. “That’s akin to declaring war!” \n“History has proven that this is the kind of war I always win,” Emma responded. “As a result of my deals, Alchemax's stock has plummeted. Their board has already dropped dozens of lawsuits, and the sanctions won’t be far behind.”\n“The humans will not sit idly by and watch Mutantkind steal away their fortunes,” Magneto warned. \n“Oh, I am well aware of that fact,” Emma laughed. “Alchemax has already hired outside forces to sabotage our efforts. At best, they hope to sink our Hellfire Trading Company ships and destroy our precious cargo. At worst, they’re willing to contaminate the waterways and blame Krakoa for the ecological upheaval. But they won’t achieve either of those outcomes.”\n“How can you be so certain of that?” Storm asked. \n“Because I have been on board the Marauder every time she has set sail with a shipment,” Emma said, “and I have fought off their pathetic attempts myself. As it turns out, the mercenaries in this day and age aren’t built nearly as sturdy as they used to be. Physically or mentally. And when I read their minds and discovered that their services were subcontracted through the Public Eye — this era’s all-seeing, all-knowing police force — well, you can only imagine the amount of blackmail material that I suddenly had on our would-be oppressors. I doubt they’ll be making any more moves against us in the foreseeable future.” \n“I’ll admit, Emma…” Storm said, “…I’m impressed. You’ve consistently been a step ahead of those attempting to oppose us.” \n“Then let me be a step ahead of those who would be willing to support us as well,” Emma replied. “The Hellfire Gala is more than just a chance to reward our existing partners with a lavish evening of dancing and dining. It’s a much-needed opportunity to forge new strategic alliances that could strengthen Krakoa’s place in this world. This may be our best chance to claim our seat at the table.”\n“And yet,” Magneto said, looking at the vacant chairs in the Quiet Council chamber, “we can barely fill our own…” \n“The Hellfire Gala could change that as well,” Emma insisted. “Raising Krakoa’s visibility, making our island part of the conversation in the world beyond its shores, could serve as a beacon to help bring our missing people back home!”\n“But it could also lead more dangerous factions directly to us as well,” Magneto argued.\n“It certainly could,” Emma admitted. “But with every hero from across reality gathered here for the festivities, I have a feeling we will be able to take on anyone foolish enough to crash the party.”\n“You have never done things in the most orthodox of ways, Emma,” Storm said, “but you have always had the best interests of Mutantkind at heart. If you truly believe another Hellfire Gala could make a difference for our people, I will take you at your word. You have earned my vote.”\n“Then it seems the future of Mutantkind lies in your hands, Magneto,” Emma said with a playful smile, “as it has so often before.”  \n“Clearly, I have my reservations, Ms. Frost,” Magneto said, “but your actions thus far have proven that you are ready and willing to face any challenges that may arise. You have the blessing of this Council to proceed with your Gala. Do not make me regret my vote.”\nWith that, Magneto and Storm stood and exited the Grove, leaving Emma behind to quietly celebrate her victory. She sat in her chair at the table of Winter — reserved for those members of the Quiet Council with more radical ideologies — and kicked her white, leather, platform-heeled boots onto the table as she leaned back and reveled in the moment. But she knew she didn’t have long to savor the moment. There were so many plans to be made! \nBefore Emma departed from the Grove, she heard a sound inside her head — a deep rumbling voice calling to her in an unintelligible language. She turned back to gaze upon the giant face of Krakoa itself, which had manifested on the giant tree at the center of the Quiet Council chamber. Emma walked over and put a gentle hand on the tree’s surface.\n“Don’t worry, dear,” she said, “I haven’t forgotten about you. I know you’ve been suffering since your trip through the timestream… but if all goes as planned, your pain will come to an end soon enough. I know the perfect person to help you. A very special Doctor. But let’s just keep that fact between you and me for the moment…” \nAs Emma Frost began to walk away, she turned back and held her index finger to her lips, signaling for Krakoa to remain silent. \n“…because if the Quiet Council knew our little secret, they would never have voted yes.”",

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10540_Story_#0_Content": "The Phoenix gently soared through the empty void of space on wings born of cosmic flame. But as the primal force of creation journeyed valiantly through uncharted regions of the cosmos, the mind of its mortal host — the Omega-level telepath called Jean Grey — was adrift amid thoughts of her home planet. Earth.\nIt had been years since Jean had left her fellow Mutants behind on Krakoa, traveling to the far reaches of the galaxy to share the Phoenix’s spark of creation with worlds in need. But even though it had only been a relatively short time, especially when compared to the Phoenix’s epic lifespan, it still felt like an eternity since Jean had last seen her old friends. At first, she had maintained her telepathic rapport with her paramour, Scott Summers, as a way to retain a bit of her own humanity. But that bond was suddenly severed when a temporal storm ripped across reality. After that unfortunate event, try as she might, Jean could no longer contact any of her allies on the living island she had once called home. It was as if they had simply vanished into the timestream… and not even the all-powerful Phoenix could find any traces of them.\nDespite all evidence suggesting that the X-Men were lost and gone forever, Jean never gave up faith that her Mutant brethren would one day return. And finally, years later, that spark of hope within her had ignited into a flame as bright as the Phoenix Force itself. Just days ago, in the silence of deep space, Jean was shocked to hear a familiar voice echo in her mind. There was no mistaking that it belonged to Magneto, and it uttered a phrase she had longed to hear for ages:\n“To me, my X-Men.”\nSpending so many years bonded to a force of nature as old as the universe itself, Jean had learned firsthand that time worked in the most mysterious of ways. So it didn’t really surprise Jean that the source of that voice was coming from seventy light years further than the distance between her and Earth. Had Magneto and Krakoa been teleported to the far reaches of the universe? Or had they somehow jumped forward decades into the future? Jean didn’t know… but she knew she had to find the answer.\nReaching out across time and space with her mental powers, Jean was soon able to confirm her suspicions. Somewhere in the future, Krakoa had finally returned. And along with it, many of her dearest friends. Ororo. Erik. Illyana. Emma. And Logan! But where was Scott…? Jean vowed to find out and wasn’t willing to waste another second. She spread the Phoenix’s flaming wings and changed her trajectory, heading straight toward the planet of her birth. But the universe, it seemed, had other plans…\nBefore she could make any progress toward Earth, the Phoenix alerted Jean of an impending crisis on the other side of the galaxy. A massive star was dying, and it was up to the Phoenix to revive it before it was fully extinguished. Billions of lives on the surrounding planets hung in the balance, so a proper welcome home for her Mutant brothers and sisters would have to wait just a little longer.\nAs soon as the Phoenix reached the fading sun, both she and Jean felt an icy chill run through them. They could immediately tell that this star wasn’t dying due to natural causes. Its brilliance was being snuffed out by an external force, almost as if a dark, unseen hand was trying to crush the star’s light within its grip. Jean had never felt anything like it before… but the Phoenix had, eons ago. There was a dark god, born at the dawn of existence who had sought to extinguish every flame in the cosmos — from the stars to the Phoenix herself. He called himself the King in Black. But others knew him as Knull.\nAs the Phoenix spoke Knull’s name, Jean could feel her partner shudder. And that made Jean shudder as well, since she had never felt anything akin to fear in the Phoenix Force before. But she knew that they couldn’t let fear stop them from their current mission. There were innocent lives on the line. Without hesitation, Jean dove into the very heart of the sun, calling upon the full fury of the Phoenix to reignite its plasma. In the process, the dark tendrils that had ensnared the star were incinerated. In a split second, Jean had saved dozens of inhabited worlds, just as she and the Phoenix had done together on so many occasions over the years. But there was no time to celebrate. If Knull had indeed returned, the Phoenix warned, then a single star system meant next to nothing compared to the death and destruction he could cause. If Knull had his way, every species in this reality would soon be on the brink of extinction.\nJean Grey wasn’t about to let some self-proclaimed king unleash his reign of terror on the universe. The Phoenix agreed, telling Jean about Knull’s last known whereabouts — the world known as Klyntar. What was once Knull’s greatest creation had ironically become his eternal prison when his own symbiotic offspring trapped him within the planet’s core. Since the universe hadn’t already been completely shrouded in his darkness, it was likely that Knull was still there, subtly spreading his influence as he worked on a way to finally escape. \nKlyntar was light years away, but fortunately, the Phoenix knew a short cut. The Divine Space was a plane of reality that only those with vast cosmic power could access and traverse. The Phoenix entered this ethereal realm with ease, but soon realized that she and her host were not alone. There, within the sacred plane, was a gathering of god-like beings, each of them bearing the stench of Knull’s oblivion. Somehow, he had corrupted these majestic beings, and they had taken refuge in the Divine Space. But had they gone there to escape Knull’s influence or to plan their next attack in their dark lord’s name? The Phoenix soon had her answer.  \n“You burn with the fury of a million suns,” growled Bast, the Wakandan Panther Goddess. “You do not belong in our master’s glorious oblivion. Your flames must be smothered!”\n“I’d like to see you try,” Jean Grey said with a smile.\nAs the Phoenix let out a cry that echoed through the Divine Space, Bast lunged at the firebird with her claws bared and her jaws open wide.\n“You will be extinguished!” Bast roared, her claws slashing straight through the Phoenix’s fiery wings.\n“I am fire and life incarnate,” the Phoenix responded, her voice echoing from her host while her wings instantly reformed, as if Bast had never touched her at all. “Today, only the darkness shall be burnt away.”\nSummoning every remaining ounce of her strength, the Phoenix released a burst of cleansing cosmic flame that washed over Bast and the other dark deities, instantly purging the corruption from them. Bast licked her wounds, but then joined the grateful gods as they bowed in reverence to the Phoenix. Reborn anew, they departed the Divine Space to return to their home pantheons.\nJean Grey and the Phoenix were now alone and exhausted. Either of their recent acts of heroism would have been more than enough to diminish their power significantly, but performing both of these epic feats back-to-back had reduced the Phoenix’s dazzling flames to a mere flicker. If they hoped to reach Klyntar with enough might to take on Knull, Jean knew that they needed to rest and recover. Luckily, the Divine Space was more than just a cosmic shortcut. This realm was also teeming with primordial forces that would help restore the Phoenix to her full glory in nearly no time at all.\nAs she floated in this peaceful plane, Jean closed her eyes and let her mind drift once more. But this time, she wasn’t sensing her friends back on Earth. Instead, thanks to the strange energies flowing through the Divine Space, she found herself catching brief glimpses of the past, the present, and… the future? A strange image formed in her mind, as real as anything she had ever experienced before. She was enveloped in a flood of scarlet energy — a raw, chaotic power that seemed to somehow simultaneously oppose and compliment the Phoenix Force. She could feel the Phoenix fighting against it at first, but eventually embracing it. The two forces reached a perfect balance, condensing into a burning scarlet crown that perched on Jean’s head.\nJean’s eyes shot open, and she reached up… but even though she could still feel the weight of the scarlet crown, it was gone. Even so, Jean knew that this had been more than just a dream. It was a vision of what was to come. And though she didn’t know exactly what it meant, she had a feeling that she would find out soon enough.\nJean didn’t know how long she had been lost in this dream state. It could have been mere moments or countless days. But in that time, the Phoenix Force had thankfully been restored to full power. Without a word shared between them, they exited the Divine Space together, leaving a glowing trail of celestial fire in their wake.

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10400_Story_#0_Content": "Dr. Reed Richards — the renowned scientist and adventurer also known as the Mister Fantastic — stood in his laboratory in the Baxter Building, closely examining a small crystal that his best friend, Ben Grimm, had recovered on one of his many excursions into lower Manhattan. Reed had his own theories about the strange energy stored within the glowing shard, but even the most brilliant man in the universe needed a second opinion every now and then. And Reed knew exactly who he had to ask for one: The most brilliant woman in any universe — Shuri, the Princess of Wakanda.\nNot long after the Timestream Entanglement erupted across the Multiverse, causing realities to collide and collapse, Reed had received an unexpected and urgent message from Wakanda. But it was not from the technologically advanced African nation that Reed and his fellow members of the Fantastic Four had long called their allies. Instead, this message came from a Wakanda located in another dimension, one where King T’Challa had taken his people to the edge of the universe and built a society that spanned the stars. \nMuch like in Reed’s own reality, T’Challa’s sister, Shuri, was the driving force behind the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda’s scientific research. So it came as no surprise that she too had been tirelessly searching for a way to undo the damage caused by the Timestream Entanglement. Fortunately, she was not too proud to admit that she could not find the solution alone. \nAfter her initial communication was received, Reed and Shuri began to compare notes and hypotheses, bringing other trusted allies like Tony Stark into their fold. Eventually, they were able to build a Timestream Reintegration Device that would theoretically be able to restore the damaged realities to their original state. Of course, finding an energy source potent enough to power the TRD would be nearly impossible, a topic which had since become the source of much debate between the device’s creators. \nReed knew deep inside that these crystals — which had come to be known as Chronovium by those studying them — were the key. But when he compared the data he had acquired from scanning this shard with recent test results gathered by Shuri, things just weren’t adding up. He had to get to the bottom of this… while there was still time left… \n“You wanted to talk, Dr. Richards?” a voice said from the other side of the computer screen. \n“Ah, Shuri,” Reed replied, as the screen lit up to reveal the face of his interdimensional ally, “I’m glad you got my message.” \n“As always, when the Fantastic Four calls,” Shuri said, “Wakanda answers.” \n“Good. Because answers are exactly what I’m seeking,” Reed said, getting right to the point. “We have both previously surmised that Chronovium is a byproduct of the massive fluctuations in energy released by the Timestream Entanglement, correct?” \n“Yes,” Shuri responded, “In both of our realities, the second law of thermodynamics still holds true. Even chronal power seeks out the lowest energy state to stabilize itself — and these crystals have the lowest internal energy in either of our universes.” \n“But that’s where the similarities end,” Reed said. “According to our data, at the very onset of the Timestream Entanglement, I had reason to believe that all Chronovium across the Multiverse shared the same basic structure. But now that our realities have continued to shift in unexpected ways, the properties of the Chronovium found within them are shifting as well.”\n“The crystals I have recently analyzed here in Wakanda are proof of that,” Shuri replied. “It seems the energy from the Vibranium Star at the heart of our empire has strengthened our form of Chronovium far beyond what was seen in earlier samples.” \n“The same goes for the Chronvium in my dimension,” Reed added. “The dark magic that is holding New York City in a state of eternal night has permeated the Chronovium crystals found here. Tony has started calling it Blood Chronovium. It’s a bit dramatic, but I suppose it gets the point across.”\n“Indeed,” Shuri said. “And it makes me wonder how many other forms may be out there… in whatever universes still remain…” \n“And that is one of the reasons why I called you,” Reed said. “If we could begin to catalog how many other universes —”\n“Chronoverses,” Shuri interjected. “That is what we here in Wakanda are calling the fractured realities created by the Timestream Entanglement.” \n“Of course,” Reed continued, “If we could catalog how many other Chronoverses there are out there, perhaps we could get a better understanding of the current state of the Multiverse, as well as the other types of Chronovium that might be at our disposal.”\n“I have identified at least one other alternate reality beyond our own,” Shuri responded without hesitation. “Recently, Captain America arrived here in Wakanda seeking refuge…”\nReed paused for a moment as Shuri spoke. The Captain America he had known had fallen in battle not long ago, and the entire world was still reeling from the loss. Logically, Reed was well aware that every reality likely had its own variant of Steve Rogers, but knowing that one was currently residing in Wakanda offered a sense of hope that Reed hadn’t felt in far too long. \n“Unlike the Captain America that both my father and my brother proudly fought alongside over the years,” Shuri said, “this Steven Rogers claimed that he had been frozen during World War II and had not been reawakened until the year 2099.” \n“That’s not the first time I’ve heard that date mentioned,” Reed noted. “Our Spider-Man told me that he was visited by one of his alternate reality counterparts, a young woman who calls herself Spider-Zero. She claimed to be from the year 2099 as well, and asked for his help to repair a dimensional nexus point known as the Web of Life and Destiny.” \n“Fascinating,” Shuri said, taking notes as she talked. “Based on Captain America’s intel, we also believe that this future timeline may be a gathering point for Mutants whose home realities have ceased to exist. His ally, Wolverine, claimed he resided on a time-displaced island nation called Krakoa.”\n“Curious,” Reed muttered as he pondered Shuri’s words. “Our Krakoa vanished without a trace when the Timestream Entanglement hit us. Could the living island in that Chronoverse be one and the same?” \n“I will see if the Captain or his allies can coerce Wolverine into sharing any further information,” Shuri said. \n“Allies?” Reed asked. “Steve brought along friends?” \n“Not quite,” Shuri said. “My own Chronoverse has been facing a number of its own challenges of late, including a growing darkness that is spreading rapidly across the star systems. I had initially sent the Guardians of the Galaxy to investigate its origin point on a distant planet called Klyntar, but I have lost contact with them. In order to prepare for whatever may be coming our way, T’Challa and I asked Steven gather some trusted allies from across time and space. Including a few from your own timeline — Hawkeye and the Winter Soldier.” \n“Interesting,” Reed said. “Tony had told me that they both went missing after an incident at a remote Hydra base. He’ll be glad they made it out alive.”\n“I certainly was,” Shuri responded. “I believe they will prove to be valuable allies in the days ahead. I fear this darkness is already tainting Wakanda. Even the gods themselves are not safe from its corruptive influence…” \n“Speaking of the gods…” Reed said as Shuri’s words trailed off, “…the Asgard in my timeline has become something entirely new. Their World Tree, Yggdrasill, has grown and merged with the golden realm to create Yggsgard. And, according to reports, Loki is already trying to take advantage of the situation.”\n“No surprise there,” Shuri said. \n“But the Asgardians aren’t the only pantheon in disarray,” Reed continued. “Stephen Strange recently returned from a trip through the Astral Plane, where he says he communicated with heroes from yet another dimension — one where powerful deities were locked in an endless war for omnipotent power and total control.”\n“So that gives us at least four Chronoverses then?” Shuri said, examining her notes.  \n“That we’ve identified thus far, yes,” Reed replied. “And as they continue to collapse and intertwine, I have a feeling that they will start to become ever more dependent upon each other for survival.” \n“With so few timelines left,” Shuri said, “we cannot risk losing any of them. That is exactly why my brother chose to pay a visit your world. I hope his delivery proved useful in your efforts.” \n“T’Challa… came here…?” Reed said, clearly puzzled. “When?”\n“He left Wakanda a week ago,” Shuri said, her usual calm and collected expression suddenly giving way to one of deep concern. “I calibrated our cross-dimensional teleporters myself. I am certain he arrived safely in the New York of your reality.” \n“Arrived safely, perhaps,” Reed said, dismayed, “but anything could have happened after that. Our city isn’t exactly as safe as it used to be, after all. The curse that locked us in a permanent nocturnal state allowed certain factions that had formerly been relegated to the shadows the opportunity to seize power.” \n“Vampires,” Shuri said, fully aware of the problem. “T’Challa had hoped to offer you a sample of our own Heart-Shaped Herb as a means of developing a cure to this plague. But if he has fallen victim to it… then…” \n“Don’t worry, your majesty,” Reed responded. “Like you said, we’re in this together. And when Wakanda calls, the Fantastic Four answers, too.” \n“I just pray to the Orisha that we are not too late…” Shuri said solemnly, “…for all of our sakes…”",

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10520_Story_#0_Content": "Lin Lie closed his eyes and opened his mind. \nHe had come to this sacred place, beneath the Tree of Immortality in the fabled city of K’un-Lun, to meditate on the current state of the universe and his place in it. And, thanks to recent events, he had far more to ponder than he had ever imagined possible.  \nLin Lie first reflected on how his own journey had brought him here. Not long ago, he was an ordinary young man living in Shanghai, just another face in a sea of 24 million. That all changed when his father, an archaeologist, gifted him an ancient and mysterious sword. Lin Lie would eventually learn that the blade was a divine weapon, known as the Sword of Fu Xi, which had been used to vanquish the demon Chiyou five millennia ago. \nPulled into a modern day conflict between ancient mystical forces, Lin Lie became the hero known as the Sword Master, wielding his legendary blade against countless foes. For a time, he fought alongside the Agents of Atlas, a network of pan-Asian heroes dedicating to combating global threats. But during a battle with a vicious Kumiho, Lin Lie found himself gravely wounded and his sacred sword shattered.  \nWhen Lin Lie awoke from his injuries, not only was he on the shores near the mystical city K’un-Lun, he was also in the presence of the ancient dragon Shou-Lao the Undying. The dragon saved Lin Lie’s life by bestowing the boy with his powerful Chi, thus granting Lin Lie the power and mantle of the protector of K’un-Lun — the Immortal Iron Fist. It was an honor that sent Lin Lie’s life spiraling in a whole new direction. But not even his newfound power could have prepared him for what was about to happen. \nA phenomenon known as the Timestream Entanglement was unleashed upon the Multiverse by a pair of mad tyrants, causing entire dimensions to collide and collapse into each other. Though K’un-Lun’s unique place just outside of reality had long kept it safe from such crises, this time, the fabled city would not escape the cosmic conflict unscathed. \nAs the Timestream Entanglement rippled through the pocket dimension in which K’un-Lun existed, the city merged with the other six Capital Cities of Heaven — K’un-Zi, Peng Lai, Tiger Island, Z’Gambo, the Kingdom of Spiders, and the Under City. In the past, these mystical realms had only existed in the same space every 88 years, converging for a great tournament between their champions, the Immortal Weapons. But now, they had been joined together far sooner than anyone could have anticipated. \nTo make matters worse, all of the other Immortal Weapons — from Crane Mother to Fat Cobra — had vanished from this newly amalgamated Heart of Heaven. Lin Lie was the only one of their number who remained… and he wondered why…\nWas it because he had not earned the power of the Iron Fist in the same method that his predecessors had, by plunging their fists into the heart of Shao-Lao? Was his legitimacy as the Iron Fist — and as an Immortal Weapon — in question? Or had the broken shards of the Sword of Fu Xi, which were now embedded within Lin Lie’s hands, somehow protected him from the fate that had befallen his fellow warriors? Lin Lie didn’t know… and meditating on the subject wasn’t providing him with the answers he had come to seek. Fortunately, a much needed distraction had arrived… \nLin Lie opened his eyes to find a green mist floating around the Tree of Immortality. Although K’un-Lun was still as silent as death itself, its protector knew he was no longer alone. \n“A thief,” Lin Lie whispered, a smile coming to his lips. Perhaps a little action would put his troubled mind at ease. But how does one fight a mist? \nLin Lie readied himself for battle, focusing the entirety of his Chi into his hand. Without warning, he felt someone strike him, first in the stomach, then in the face. It was almost as if he was being attacked by a ghost — a very strong ghost, for that matter. As the mist blurred his vision, Lin Lie swung his glowing fist blindly, delivering a mighty blow that split the fog in half. But even an Iron Fist can’t do much damage to an intangible foe. \nThe mist came back together again, swirling around the Tree of Immortality once more before vanishing altogether. Along with it, a single piece of enchanted fruit had vanished as well. \n“Where —?!” Lin Lie gasped, surveying the area for any sign of his mysterious opponent.  \nHe caught a glimpse of the green fog rematerializing atop the wall surrounding the courtyard. Moments later, the mist coalesced into a distinctly human form. Lin Lie couldn’t identify the thief from this distance, but that didn’t stop him from giving chase. \nLin Lie let out a cry of intense pain as he leapt into the air and pulled back his fists. Long shards of mystic metal — the remnants of the Sword of Fu Xi — extended from the backs of his hands. He plunged them into the stone and used the blades to scale the wall with ease. \nBy the time he reached the top, the thief was already on the run, racing over the rooftops of K’un-Lun as he effortlessly changed between his solid and misty forms. Lin Lie did not have the same luxury and found himself having to make extraordinary leaps between buildings in order to stay on the thief’s trail. Every time Lin Lie managed to get closer, the thief turned in a new direction, as if he knew every corner of K’un-Lun and the other Capital Cities by heart. \n“Who are you?” Lin Lie wondered, picking up his pace. \nSoon, the thief diverted his path from the rooftops down to the lowest levels of the city. There, he reached a secret gateway that Lin Lie had never seen before. \n“Stop!” Lin Lie yelled before the thief could cross through.\nThe thief glanced back for a second and Lin Lie finally recognized who he was. The Prince of Orphans. The Immortal Weapon from Z’Gambo. But what was he doing here? Why was he stealing the enchanted fruit? And where in the heavens was he leading Lin Lie? \nAs the Prince of Orphans vanished through the gate, Lin Lie noticed some symbols newly-etched in the stone archway above it:\n暗黑之地.An’hay-Zhidi. The Land of Shadows. \nWhen Lin Lie crossed through the gateway, he found himself in an unfamiliar realm. Certainly, this wasn’t part of any of the Seven Capital Cities he had visited before. He was in what seemed to be a thriving underworld full of criminals and Yaoguai — ancient demons. But there were also normal people walking the shadowy streets as well, going about their lives. \nLin Lie wished he had the time to explore this strange place to find more answers. But he knew he couldn’t afford to lose track of the Prince of Orphans. Hopefully, his fellow Immortal Weapon could shed some light on this dark place. \nThe green mist entered through the window of a small dwelling at the back of an alley; Lin Lie did not hesitate to follow it inside. Upon entry, he was immediately attacked by the Prince of Orphans, who delivered his signature move — the Jawsnapper in Twilight. Lin Lie was instantly laid low by the brutal strike.\n“I expected better from an Iron Fist,” the Prince of Orphans said, extending a hand to help Lin Lie up off the ground. \nLin Lie rubbed his aching jaw. \n“Yeah, well…” he replied. “I’m no Danny Rand. As everyone keeps reminding me…”\n“I do not expect you to be,” the Prince of Orphans said. “There were sixty-seven Iron Fists before you. And there will be plenty more after. Do not try to be them. Strive to be the best you.” \nThe Prince of Orphans pulled the enchanted fruit he had stolen from his satchel. Its glistening golden skin had turned a deep, withered brown. \n“Fun Fact,” Lin Lie said. “As soon as a fruit is plucked from the Tree of Immortality, it begins to die.”\n“I know…” the Prince of Orphans said, dismayed. “I had just hoped I would get back here fast enough…”\n“Why do you even need it?” Lin Lie asked. “You seem to be in pretty good shape for a guy your age. Or any age…”\n“It is not for me,” the Prince of Orphans replied, walking over to a basket in the corner of the room and pulling back a blanket. “It is for her.”\nLin Lie gazed into the basket to see an infant girl with pale skin, blue eyes, and strawberry blonde hair. She strained as she reached toward Lin Lie, who instinctively backed away, knowing nothing about handling children. \n“You have a kid?!” he asked. \n“The girl is not mine,” the Prince of Orphans replied. “Or at least she wasn’t. I found her during the war. Alone. Abandoned.” \n“Well, I guess you lived up to your name,” Lin Lie joked. Then his face suddenly turned serious. “Wait… what war?” \n“You have not ventured outside of K’un-Lun much lately, have you?” the Prince of Orphans said. \nThe Prince of Orphans began to explain how the very same chronal catastrophe that had caused the Seven Capital Cities of Heaven to combine had also collapsed several timelines into each other. Now, the ancient forces and elder gods that lived in those timelines were waging an epic battle against each other for total domination. \nThough there were many forces fighting for the good of all dimensions — including a warrior child who had become a demon queen, a jade giant guarding the door to a nuclear purgatory, and red sorceress holding reality together from a mountaintop in Europe — their numbers were few… and growing ever smaller every day. \n“Then what are we doing here?” Lin Lie asked. “Why aren’t we out there fighting?”\n“Some things must take priority,” the Prince of Orphans said, motioning towards the baby, who let out a terrible cough and began to cry. “She became sick, and so I had to seek refuge. Z’Gambo was not where I had left it, but I was offered refuge by Dizang. Little did I know it would lead me back home… in a way…” \n“Dizang?” Lin Lie asked, curious who this mysterious savior could be. \n“He built this place…” the Prince of Orphans responded, “…or at least remade it in his image. It used to be known as the Eighth City.”\n“Wait! I’ve heard of that!” Lin Lie exclaimed. “It was the prison realm for the Seven Capital Cities of Heaven, right?”\n“And now it is a refuge for all those who have been displaced by this war,” the Prince of Orphans said. “Including me… and little Laussa here…” \nLin Lie looked back at the baby. The color was quickly fading from her cheeks. He knew she was struggling to survive, and he couldn’t just stand there and let such an innocent creature continue to suffer. \n“Hold on,” he said, smiling gently as he took hold of the rapidly decaying fruit. “A little of my Chi should return this to peak freshness in no time.”\nAs Lin Lie’s hand began to glow, the fruit’s skin turned back to its original golden hue. \n“How can I repay you?” the Prince of Orphans asked, immediately cutting the fruit with a knife and handing a small piece to his tiny ward to nibble on. \n“I was always told you were one of the best fighters the Immortal Weapons ever had,” Lin Lie said. “Clearly, I could use your help. I mean, I can hold my own, but I’ve got a long way to go before I reach your skill level.”\n“You never trained in the martial arts with Lei-Kung?” the Prince of Orphans asked. \n“The Thunderer is big on tradition,” Lin Lie replied, “I didn’t exactly get my power in the most customary of ways, remember?”\n“I suppose I could teach you a thing or two,” the Prince of Orphans said. “Show me your guard stance.” \n“Wait,” Lin Lie said, surprised. “Like right now?” \n“If you wish me to be your mentor,” the Prince of Orphans replied sternly, “you work on my schedule. If you truly hope to be one of the great Iron Fists, we need to start with close combat. Wing Chun. Then we can move into some weapon techniques… perhaps the Bart Cham Dao…”\n“The Eight Cutting Blades?” Lin Lie said excitedly. “I like the sound of that!”\nBefore he could enjoy the moment too much, however, Lin Lie’s impromptu training session was interrupted by a pounding on the dwelling’s door. \n“I do not,” the Prince of Orphans said as he walked over to a small window and peered outside to see several armed K’un-Lun guards waiting in the alley. \n“Friends of yours?” the Prince of Orphans asked Lin Lie. \n“I forgot to tell you,” Lin Lie responded, nervously rubbing the back of his neck. “Stealing fruit from the Tree of Immortality is punishable… by death…” \n“I find the irony amusing,” the Prince of Orphans replied. \n“Those guys probably followed us to make sure I finished the job,” Lin Lie continued. \n“And are you going to?” the Prince of Orphans asked, curiously raising an eyebrow. \nLin Lie smiled at his new mentor. \n“No,” he responded. “I’m going to convince them that some laws were meant to be broken.”\n“With your fists?” the Prince of Orphans asked. \n“With my words,” Lin Lie replied. “Sometimes the biggest victories come from the battles we choose not to fight.”\nThe Prince of Orphans was impressed by the young Iron Fist’s wisdom. But as he followed Lin Lie  through the door of his home and out into the alleyway, K’un-Lun’s guards instantly raised their weapons, ready to strike. \n“I do not think they are interested in talking,” the Prince of Orphans said, readying himself for the fight to come. “And so, Lin Lie, your first lesson begins…”\nAs Lin Lie began to focus his Chi once again, a commanding voice rang out from the other end of the alley. \n“Enough!” it yelled. “There will be no blood shed on my streets!” \nA man stepped forward, his body wrapped in cloth so black it was hard to tell where he ended and the shadows began.\n“Dizang,” the Prince of Orphans said, dropping to one knee and bowing his head in respect. “We meant no harm.” \n“And none shall be delivered,” Dizang replied. “These guards were merely doing their duty… but they are beyond their jurisdiction. They are free to go.”\n“How about me…?” Lin Lie asked as the guards turned and fled back to K’un-Lun. \n“You may stay…” Dizang replied. “…at your own risk. There are those here who wish to see the Iron Fist defeated, some of whom are bold enough to try to claim your power for themselves.”\n“Bring ‘em on,” Lin Lie said confidently. \n“Just as K’un-Lun is yours protect,” Dizang continued, “this city is mine. Should you disrupt the delicate balance I have created here, you will answer to me.” \nWith that, Dizang effortlessly leapt between the walls of the alleyway, back and forth as he ascended to the rooftop above. As he reached the top, he paused a moment and silently peered down on Lin Lie. The full moon shone behind him, framing Dizang’s silhouette in a way that sent chills down Lin Lie’s spine. \n“So…” the Prince of Orphans said as Dizang disappeared into the shadows, “…where were we?”\nLin Lie honestly wasn’t sure how to answer that question… but suddenly, he was desperate to find out…",

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10250_Story_#0_Content": "The back alleys of New York City had never been safe. Back when Tyrone Johnson and Tandy Bowen were just teenage runaways, they’d found themselves fighting to survive the cruel realities of living on the streets. When they gained their superpowers, becoming the crime fighting duo known as Cloak and Dagger, they vowed to shed a little light — and darkness — on the most dangerous corners of the city so that no one else would ever have to live in fear again. \nBut now, fear had taken over — not just in the alleys, but across the entire island of Manhattan. Dracula, the Lord of the Vampires, had come to town, and had somehow managed to lock the Big Apple in a state of eternal night. His bloodsucking minions were on a rampage, and there were only a few heroes left to protect the innocent citizens of NYC from being involuntarily drafted into the vampire army’s ranks.  \n“Watch out, Ty!” Dagger yelled. “On your left!”  \n“I see ‘em, Tandy,” Cloak replied, turning to face three vampires that were rushing toward him, their teeth bared in a bloodthirsty frenzy.\nCloak opened his billowing cape, revealing the pure darkness shrouded within. \n“Chew on this, boys,” Cloak said as three ebony tendrils reached out from the void and ensnared the unsuspecting vamps. They struggled to break free, but to no avail. The vampires were pulled into the living portal to the Darkforce Dimension that was where Cloak’s body should have been. As they disappeared into the pitch black, Cloak smiled, knowing what went in rarely came back out.\n“You let them off easy… again,” Dagger said, her voice echoing in Cloak’s mind. “You do know vampires thrive in the dark, right?” \n“Sorry,” Cloak said, growing annoyed by Dagger’s constant critiquing. “Fresh out of light. Maybe if you were here, you could’ve finished ‘em off, like you do. But tonight’s my night, remember?” \n“Yeah…” Dagger replied, with a deep sadness that Cloak could feel in his own soul. “How could I forget…?”\nCloak breathed a heavy sigh. His partner wasn’t the only one who was struggling with their current status quo. \nShortly before the creatures of the night had seized the city, Cloak and Dagger were on a routine mission busting some smugglers on the Lower East Side when the world turned upside down — or more accurately, in their case, inside out. \nNormally, a few petty criminals would never have stood a chance against a pair of seasoned super heroes like Cloak and Dagger, but during the fight something strange happened. A burst of light appeared in the sky, brighter than anything Dagger had ever conjured up with her Lightforce powers. As it washed over the city, Dagger instinctively leapt into Cloak’s portal and the two teleported away to safety, as they had done countless times before. \nCloak reemerged shortly after, safe and sound. But when he opened the folds of his cape, Dagger didn’t follow. Cloak feared that his partner had become lost in the Darkforce Dimension, but those fears were quickly negated when he heard Tandy’s voice in his head as clear as day. She was there with him… but at the same time she wasn’t. \nCloak opened himself up again, straining with all of his might as he tried to summon Dagger’s physical form through the portal within him. Suddenly, beams of pure Lightforce erupted from Cloak’s body. He let out an anguished scream and, where he had just stood, Dagger had taken his place.  But now, Cloak was gone. And yet, he wasn’t. If he had been thrust back into the Darkforce Dimension, he could have easily navigated his way back out. But this was something else entirely. It was as if Cloak was looking at the world through Dagger’s eyes. \nBaffled by what had happened to them, Dagger sought out the help of a trusted friend — Reed Richards, the brilliant scientist and super hero known as Mister Fantastic. Reed told them that the bright light they had seen in the sky was caused by a massive disruption to the fabric of space and time itself, an event that he was calling the Timestream Entanglement. The cosmic disturbance had cascaded across multiple dimensions, leading to all sorts of unusual effects, such as causing some alternate realities to merge together into one. \nHe surmised that, since Cloak and Dagger happened to be traveling between dimensions together when the Timestream Entanglement struck their reality, they themselves had somehow become entangled with one another on a molecular level. Now, they seemed to exist in the same material space, and only one of them could occupy it at any given time. Curiously, even when one of them was physically absent, their consciousness remained fully present within the mind of the predominant partner. \nReed ran a number of tests, in hopes of finding a solution to the duo’s dilemma, but nothing seemed to work. He promised the young heroes that he wouldn’t give up… but for now, they would have to make the best of their new situation. \nCloak mused that Dagger had always been the angel on his shoulder over the many years they had been partners. The fact that she was now quite literally a voice inside of his head and nothing more was going to take some time to get used to. Unfortunately, even more change was on the horizon than he had initially realized.\nWhen the vampires took control of Manhattan, the heroes tried to go about business as usual. At first, Dagger wanted nothing more than to use her Lightforce energy to heal those who had been infected by Dracula’s curse. Meanwhile, Cloak wasn’t nearly as forgiving to the sinister creatures that had overrun his city. But as time went by, Dagger became more aggressive in her attacks against the vampires, while Cloak had a tendency to show more mercy to the poor people who had fallen under Dracula’s sway. Their traditional roles were reversing, giving Cloak reason for concern.\nTo make matters worse, there was a rift growing between their fellow heroes as well. Reed Richards was determined to cure the city of Dracula’s curse with as little collateral damage as possible. He knew that many of the vampires stalking the streets had been innocent civilians when this all began, and he wanted to do whatever it took to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. But Tony Stark and his ally Moon Knight had learned of a more permanent means of removing the vampire threat in one fell swoop. Cloak could feel that Dagger was beginning to lean towards that more extreme option, and it scared him to see her once-unwavering light beginning to flicker. \n“Tandy…” Cloak said, finally working up the courage to confront his partner about her descent toward the darkness. “We’ve gotta talk.” \n“No,” Dagger replied. “We’ve gotta fight. We don’t have the time to worry about feelings, Ty. This is war. When are you gonna finally man up and act like it?”\nCloak paused, trying to keep his temper in check. He had known Tandy for so long, but it was almost like he didn’t know her at all anymore. Was this his fault, he wondered? Could her shift in demeanor have been caused by prolonged exposure to the Darkforce energies that Cloak himself had barely learned to control, even after all these years? Dagger’s light had always been the force that guided them. What if it was finally snuffed out and he was to blame? \nCloak’s concerns would have to wait. He had just received a message from Reed Richards, asking him to come back to the Baxter Building — which the heroes had been using as a stronghold since the vampiric invasion. In a blink, Cloak teleported away. \nMoments later, Dagger materialized in the Baxter Building. During the teleportation process, Tandy had exerted her will and had taken control of their shared physical form for herself. Cloak was less than thrilled, but he chose to remain silent and to observe… for now.\n“What’s the deal, Reed?” Dagger asked, showing a touch of impatience. “You know we’re way more help out on the streets than here in your lab, right?”\n“Indeed,” Reed said. “You are needed on the front lines. But I think we both can agree that it would be better if there were two of you fighting this fight instead of just one.” \n“What’re you saying…?” Dagger asked, a glimmer of hope returning to her eyes. \n“As you know, Tony and I have been designing technology that may be capable of repairing the timestream,” Reed said. “This Timestream Reintegration Device could undo the damage caused by the Timestream Entanglement and restore this reality — and countless others — to its original state.”\n“Do you think it could do the same thing for me and Cloak?” Dagger asked, jumping straight to the point.\n“In theory,” Reed said. “The problem is, we haven’t yet located an adequate source of Chronovium to power the TRD. And a failed trial run could set us back months, a risk that Tony is not willing to take. However…”\nReed stretched his elastic-like arm over to his workbench, about ten feet away. He grabbed hold of a small, high-tech device and retracted his limb back to its normal proportions. He held up the device for Dagger — and Cloak — to see.\n“…this is a portable version of the TRD that I’ve been tinkering with,” Reed continued. “It’s not capable of realigning entire realities, but perhaps it could handle recalibrating something else that had become entangled. Something on a slightly smaller scale…” \n“Tandy…” Cloak said hesitantly within the mind of his partner, “…I really don’t wanna be the guinea pig in another experiment. I think we should wait and —“\n“We’re in,” Dagger said, completely dismissing Cloak’s concern. \n“Good,” Reed said, placing a small shard of Chronovium crystal into the handheld device. “Now, stay very still. And try not to scream too loud. Franklin and Valeria are sleeping upstairs.” \nAs the device activated, it bathed Tandy in a crackling cascade of energy. She grimaced in pain, feeling as though she was being ripped in half. And in essence, she was. The device was extracting Cloak’s molecules from her own, in hopes of allowing both young heroes to live as separate beings for the first time in ages. When the energy faded, Dagger still remained… and Cloak stood by her side!\n“He did it!” Dagger exclaimed, wrapping her arms around her partner in glee. \n“Yeah… great…” Cloak said, clearly less enthusiastic about the process. Part of it was because Dagger had gone against his direct wishes. But Cloak also had a deep fear that he would no longer be able to keep his partner’s emerging darkness under check now that they were separated. \n“Hmm…” Reed said, putting a hand to his chin as he studied the readings on his handheld TRD. “That’s strange…” \n“What’s wrong,” Dagger asked nervously. “It worked, didn’t it?”\n“Mostly,” Reed replied, “but even though you once again exist simultaneously within the same physical plane, it seems as though your energy signatures are still deeply intertwined.” \n“What’s that mean, Big Brain?” Cloak asked. \n“It means the change may not be permanent,” Reed said, dismayed. “If you were to activate the same conditions that triggered the initial molecular fusion, I’m afraid you’re more than likely to revert into your shared state.” \n“So, no more teleporting then…?” Dagger asked. “Eh. Works for me.” \n“But… that’s, like, my whole thing…” Cloak replied. \n“Not anymore, partner,” Dagger said. “You can do lots of other stuff with your Darkforce, right? Get creative!” \n“I… guess I can figure somethin’ out…” Cloak said, uncertain. \n“It looks like you’re going to have to figure it out much sooner than anticipated,” Reed interrupted. “Ben just reported in from his transport mission, and he says he located a cluster of vampires attacking some citizens near Battery Park.”\n“No sweat. We’ll be there in —” Cloak started to say, but then he paused as Dagger shot him a dirty look. He realized that they could no longer travel between locations in split seconds via the Darkforce Dimension. \n“Umm… could we borrow a Fantasti-Car?” \nSoon, Cloak and Dagger landed their borrowed vehicle on the southern tip of Manhattan. The two heroes stepped off and began to scout the area for any sign of vampires. \n“Now, this is more like it!” Dagger said. “Just like the old days.”\n“Yeah,” Cloak agreed, “Except for that part…” \nDagger looked over at where Cloak was pointing to see a horde of vampires overtaking a ferry boat docked nearby. \n“People must’ve been tryin’ to use the ferry to get out of the city,” Cloak said, “and now they’ve gone and got themselves trapped on board. Those vamps’ll eat ‘em alive. We’ve gotta help.”\n“Or…” Dagger said, “…we could just hit the throttle, send the whole thing to Staten Island, and call it a night.”\nCloak looked over at Dagger in disbelief, uncertain whether his partner was joking or not. Either way he wasn’t amused. Instead of dignifying her comment with a response, he rushed toward the ferry to confront the vampires. \n“Keep up,” he called back to Dagger. She shook her head and followed Cloak into action. \nWhen they boarded the ferry, the pair kicked into full hero mode, picking off the vampires with ease. Dagger manifested short blades of pure Lightforce that she mercilessly thrust into the hearts of the vampires. Cloak used his Darkforce tendrils to grab hold of their fanged foes and hurl them overboard. \nAs Cloak and Dagger fought side-by-side once more, they both began to remember how much they missed their partnership… and perhaps how much they had taken it for granted. Just when they were starting to finally find their rhythm, though, they reached the ferry’s control room and were met by a harsh reality. Inside, there were several human passengers, all huddled together. A group of vampires had them surrounded and looked ready to feast. \n“I’ve got this,” Dagger said, rushing toward the ship’s bridge without hesitation. \n“Careful, girl,” Cloak said, grabbing a hold of Dagger’s wrist for a moment to stop her from leaving. “You ask me, this looks like a trap.”\n“I didn’t ask you, Ty,” Dagger snapped back. “And if you don’t stop babying me, I won’t ask you anything ever again! Now let me go! I’ve got people to save.” \nCloak released Dagger’s wrist and watched as his partner entered the control room. He wanted so badly to protect her, but she was her own hero and she had to make her own choices… for better or for worse. He let out a frustrated sigh and began to follow Dagger into the bridge, but before he could enter, the heavy door that led into the room slammed shut and a vampire locked it from within. Just as Cloak had feared, the vamps had used the innocent passengers to lure the heroes in, and Dagger had taken the bait. There was no escape… No way out… Except for one… \n“I’m comin’ in, Tandy…” Cloak yelled, the fabric of his cape beginning to ripple in an otherworldly breeze. \n“No! Don’t do it,” Dagger commanded. “I can handle this.” \nAnd at first, it looked as though she was right. Tandy fought for her life, hurling her light daggers at the vampires with furious speed. But there were just too many of them. Cloak could only watch through the window in horror as his partner found herself outnumbered, exhausted, and cornered along with the other terrified passengers in the bridge. \n“You gave it your best,” Cloak said, opening his cape and tapping into the full power of the Darkforce Dimension. “Now it’s my turn.”\n“You can’t!” Dagger yelled, desperately pushing back another hungry vampire.  “Remember what Reed said!” \n“I don’t care what Reed said!” Cloak snapped back. “All I care about is you!” \n“Well, if you teleport, you’re gonna lose me,” Dagger responded.\n“And if I do nothin’, I lose you, too,” Cloak said, knowing full well the gravity of the choice he was about to make. \nStill, Cloak teleported into the room, mere moments before the vampires could sink their teeth into Dagger’s flesh. He quickly wrapped his arms around her as the fabric of his cape encircled the other passengers. In a blink, they were all gone. \nMoments later, Cloak appeared at the Baxter Building in a flash of darkness. With him, he brought a small group of relieved strangers who had been snatched from death’s door at the last second. But even though the innocent civilians had been saved, someone else had been lost along the way. \nCloak looked around frantically. His heart dropped as his worst fears were confirmed.  \n“Don’t worry, Ty,” Dagger’s voice said inside of his head. “I’m still here… Whether I like it or not…” \n“I’d rather have you mad than dead,” Cloak responded, trying not to show his joy that some part of Tandy had survived the encounter. \n“Then you got what you wanted,” Dagger sighed. After a long pause, she added, “Thanks… I guess…”\n“I know the darkness has taken its toll on you,” Cloak said, “but I’m always gonna be here to lead you through it. Just like you’ve always been there to guide me back to the light. That’s why you and me are such a good team.”\n“We’re a lot more than that…” Dagger said, her tone softening for the first time in ages. Ty wished he could look into her eyes and say what was really in his heart, but at that moment, just hearing her voice was enough. It would have to be. \nWith that, his cloak folded in on itself and he vanished from the Baxter Building. He was headed back into the night, ready to take on the forces of darkness by himself…\n…but never alone.",

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10510_Story_#0_Content": "Ever since New York City became locked in a state of eternal night, the members of the Fantastic Four had been working tirelessly to protect the innocent civilians of Manhattan from the vampires who had overtaken the island. Of course not every civilian was so innocent… and not all of them wanted to be protected… \n“Go home, ya big lug!” a voice shouted from an apartment window. \nAs Ben Grimm, the hero known as the Thing, looked up to see who was shouting at him, he was pelted in the side of the head by a tomato. And then another. And then another, each one coming from a different direction. He shouldn’t have expected any less. After all, he was on Yancy Street. \nAs the tomatoes’ slimy seeds dripped down Ben’s stony face, he let out a huge sigh. This was the street he grew up on. It was the first place he ever felt like he belonged. And yet, instead of celebrating him when he became a big time superhero, the folks in the old neighborhood treated Ben as if he was a sellout. Still, while the kids in the Yancy Street Gang might have stocked up on over-ripe fruit and vegetables to hurl every time Ben paid his home turf a visit, it hadn’t deterred the Thing from checking in every day to make sure the people he cared about were safe. \n“Thanks for the sauce,” Ben yelled to his assailants as he wiped off the pulverized produce. “Next time, could ya throw some pasta my way? Maybe a nice loaf of bread?” \n“A guy your size don’t need that many carbs!” another voice yelled back. \n“Can’t blame a guy for tryin’ to get a free bite,” Ben replied, forcing a smile. \n“Depends who they’re bitin’!” a third voice yelled. “You see any vamps down there, tell ‘em the Yancy Street Gang ain’t no one’s dinner!” \n“That’s what I’m here to make sure of, ya ungrateful punks,” Ben mumbled to himself. \nAs he strolled down the street, everything seemed quiet at first. Ben knew far too well from his many years as a hero that it usually meant something bad was about to happen. As usual, his instincts were right on target. \nAs he turned the corner, Ben saw a young boy in the alley next to Kurtzberg’s Kosher Bakery who had been cornered by a vampire. The boy — about the age of Ben’s nephew Franklin — looked terrified. But as soon as he saw the Thing round the corner, he tried to put on a brave front. \n“I told you lousy fangers,” the boy barked, “no one messes with the Yancy Street Gang! We got friends in high places!” \n“Oh, so now we’re friends?” Ben quipped, deliberately drawing the vampire’s attention away from the boy. “Good thing… ‘cause this ‘big lug’ always takes care of his own!”\nWith that, Ben rushed towards the vampire, pulling his gigantic rocky fist back to deliver a crushing blow. The punch managed to knock the monster’s fangs clean out of his mouth. The wounded vampire clutched at its jaw in pain before fleeing from the alley. The boy breathed a sigh of relief, then puffed up his chest in a show of bravado. \n“Coulda handled him myself, ya know,” he said to the Thing. \n“Uh huh,” Ben replied. “I’m sure ya coulda. And I promise I won’t tell your fellow hooligans that I lent a hand. But I need you to do me a favor first…” \n“Fine,” the boy replied. “But just this once.” \n“I’ve been lookin’ for someone,” Ben started. “A special friend…” \n“Ain’t that sweet!” the boy laughed. “But trust me, no gal in her right mind is lookin’ for a fella with your busted mug!”\nBen just glared at the boy, who quickly realized that this wasn’t the time for more jokes and insults. \n“Sorry… bad habit…” \n“The FF, we’ve got a pal who went missin’,” Ben continued, “and when it comes to what happens on the streets of New York, you kids have got a better intel network than Nick Fury.”\n“That’s ‘cause we’ve got more eyes,” the boy said.\n“True, true,” Ben said, unable to hide a smirk. “So tell, me… have any of those eyes seen the Black Panther lurkin’ around anywhere?” \n“The guy in the cat suit?” the boy replied, “Not exactly… but we have heard whispers that some of the vamps around these parts are answerin’ to a new king. And it ain’t the old, pasty guy livin’ in that Central Park castle neither.”\n“So, Dracula’s got some competition for his throne?” Thing asked.\n“That’s the rumor at least,” the boy said, “and we’ve got reason to believe it’s true. My buddy Stanley went on a supply run into the Village yesterday and saw a group of fangers all lined up like they were some sort of army. Real organized and disciplined. Not all wild and savage, like that freak you just clocked in the kisser.” \n“Where’d your buddy see ‘em?” Ben asked. \n“Not too far from here,” the boy replied. “Over in Washington Square Park.” \n“Thanks, kid,” Ben said, patting the boy on the shoulder with his massive stone hand. “You’re one of the good ones.” \n“Wish I could say the same,” the boy said with a wink before running out of the alley toward the safety of his apartment building. Ben couldn’t help but chuckle… but he knew things were about to get a whole lot less amusing. \nWhen Ben reached Washington Square Park, he was shocked to discover that the young Yancy Street Gang member had been telling the truth. There, in the center of the park, was a group of vampires, all practicing fighting moves as if they were running a military training exercise. And Ben had seen their combat style countless times before. These were the same ferocious attacks employed in battle by the Black Panther himself. \nNormally, if Ben had come across a gathering of vampires this big, he would have rushed into the park with his fists flailing. But this time around, he wasn’t looking for a fight. He was looking for a friend. So instead, he watched the vampires complete their training exercise and then followed them as they marched back to a seemingly abandoned building, \nOnce the vampires were inside, Ben knew it was time to make his move. He knocked gently on the door. When there was no answer, he shrugged and knocked it right off its hinges with a single punch. The vampires within immediately turned toward the door and raced toward Ben, their fangs bared. \n“Easy fellas,” Ben said, pushing his way through the hungry horde. “I just came to talk to your boss.” \n“No one sees the king,” one of the vampires hissed. \n“Tonight,” a booming voice said from the shadows, “we shall make an exception.”\nThe vampires backed away from the Thing, clearing a path as a majestic figure stepped into the light, clad in ornate white armor that had the heads of fearsome beasts carved into each shoulder. As Ben had hoped, he found himself face-to-face with his lost ally, the Black Panther. But Ben knew T’Challa well enough that he could instantly see something was wrong. The king’s eyes glowed red and his teeth were unusually sharp. Somehow, Ben realized, the vampires must have gotten to T’Challa and turned him into one of their own. \n“What a revoltin’ development this is,” Ben said as he gazed at his old friend. \n“Indeed,” T’Challa replied. “I had come here from my Intergalactic Empire to cure this reality of the plague that has befallen it. And yet, I soon found myself to be its next victim. While I was able to survive my initial encounter with the Lord of the Vampires, I had to go into hiding until I was sure I could control the hunger that had overcome me.” \n“You shoulda just come to us,” Ben said. “Suzie makes one heck of a brisket.”\n“I could not risk putting my closest allies in danger,” T’Challa said. “And, much to my surprise, I was not alone for long. For some reason, I was able to exert my command over the other vampires I encountered. Soon, I had amassed a small army of loyal followers.”  \n“Once a king, always a king,” Ben mused. “Must be in the blood. Umm… No pun intended…” \n“Actually, it seems my blood is no different than any other vampire,” T’Challa said. “The power once granted to me by the Heart-Shaped Herb has all but faded. I am but a shadow of my former self without it.” \n“Too bad,” Ben said. “That fancy herb of yours ain’t exactly somethin’ we can get at the local grocer. Does Wakanda make deliveries?” \n“I have lost communication with my empire,” T’Challa said, reaching into a pouch hidden in his armor, “but I did bring one Heart-Shaped Herb with me on this journey.”\n“Then what the heck are you waitin’ for?” Ben asked. \n“I had hoped to give this sample to your teammate, Reed Richards, in order to synthesize a cure for vampirism,” T’Challa said. \n“We can always find a way to get more herbs,” Ben replied, “but you can’t be replaced. I’m sure Stretcho would agree.”\n“I… suppose you are right…” T’Challa said, gazing at the herb in his hand, which gave off a gentle purple glow. \nT’Challa took a deep breath, put the Heart-Shaped Herb in his mouth, and began to chew on its leaves. In mere moments, his eyes began to return to normal and his fangs began to retract. The curse that had befallen T’Challa was being undone. But the herb had another side effect as well. The vampires around T’Challa all began to sniff at the air wildly, as if searching for the source of something delicious… \n“I feared this would happen,” T’Challa said as his own army suddenly began to turn against him. “Dracula suggested that the herb made my blood irresistible to his kind.” \n“Then give me some of it, yer highness” Ben said, “and let me handle the rest.”\n“I told you, I do not have another herb,” T’Challa said, as he leapt up into the rafters of the building.\n“Don’t need it,” Ben replied. “All I want is your blood.” \n“Hopefully not as badly as they do,” T’Challa mused as he looked down to see the vampires that he once controlled jumping reaching towards him in desperation. \nT’Challa pulled back the armored sleeve covering his forearm. Unsheathing the razor-sharp claws on his opposite hand, he did not hesitate as he drew them across his exposed flesh. Blood began to run from the fresh wound, trickling down onto the Thing below. \n“Gotta admit, I preferred the tomatoes,” Ben said as the Wakandan king’s blood coated his rocky hide, “but if it’s your blood these jerks are after, I’ll give ‘em what they want.”  \nThe vampires instantly forgot about T’Challa, who was hiding safely out of reach above them, and turned their frenzied bloodlust on the Thing. They frantically tried to sink their teeth into Ben, but failed to puncture his rocky exterior. \n“Sorry, kids,” Ben said. “I may be sweet on the inside, but on the outside, I’m just as tough as I look.”\nAs the vampires chipped their fangs on the Thing’s stone hide, T’Challa called down to his ally. \n“These vampires may seem like the enemy,” he said, “but they were turned to darkness by Dracula, just as I was. They served me loyally and harmed no innocents while under my command. Despite their current state, I implore you to show them some mercy.” \n“Mercy?” Ben said with a tinge of disappointment. “But… it was almost Clobberin’ Time!” \nInstead of attacking the vampires directly, Ben honored T’Challa’s request and hit the ground as hard as he could. The impact sent a powerful shockwave cascading across the floor of the building, knocking all of the vampires temporarily unconscious. \n“Oopsie,” Ben said as the entire building began to shake around him. “We gotta get outta here, T’Challa!”\n“We cannot leave them behind,” T’Challa said. \n“You won’t have to,” a voice said from the doorway. It was Reed Richards — brilliant scientist, fearless adventurer, and Ben’s teammate in the Fantastic Four. \n“Fancy seeing you here, Stretcho,” Ben said, to his best friend, “but I ain’t complainin’!” \n“When you didn’t return from your patrol, I followed your personal locator beacon here,” Reed said. “And I brought something special with me, just in case you ran into trouble…”\nReed extended his arm to show Ben a strange, high-tech device. \n“Please tell me that’s some sorta anti-vampire ray,” Ben said. \n“No,” T’Challa said. “I recognize that from the designs my sister showed me. It is a miniaturized version of the Timestream Reintegration Device, is it not?” \n“Correct,” Reed said. “And while it only had limited success during its first test run, I’ve made some adjustments that may prove useful.” \n“Less talkin’, more doin’!” Ben said as chunks of debris began to rain down on him and the unconscious vampires. \nReed activated the portable TRD and the entire room began to glow. Suddenly, the building began to reassemble itself, as if the damage to the structure that the Thing caused had never occurred. \n“It is as if the device is rewinding time itself…” T’Challa said. \n“Well, how about that?” Ben added as he watched in awe. “Gotta bring along one of those doohickeys next time I fight the Hulk…” \n“I am afraid the effects were stronger than you intended,” T’Challa said, suddenly grimacing in pain. “My hunger has returned. I have been restored to my vampiric state…”\n“Ain’t that a kick in the pants,” Ben said. “But if you’re back to bein’ a vampire again, what did the TRD do to your loyal royal subjects?”\nBen, Reed, and T’Challa turned to see that what was once a room full of bloodthirsty vampires was now full of ordinary people. They were disoriented and confused, but they were grateful to be human again. \n“You have saved them,” T’Challa said.\n“And now, it’s time to save you, T’Challa,” Reed replied.\n“There is no one in this universe, or any other, that I trust more to do the job,” T’Challa said. \nBen looked at T’Challa in utter disbelief. \n“After all we’ve been through?” he said. “Yeesh! What’s a guy gotta do to finally get a little respect?!”",
    "UIHeroStoryTable_10500_Story_#0_Content": "Susan Richards took a deep breath as she stood by the window of the Baxter Building and gazed out at a city bathed in darkness. According to the atomic clock that her husband Reed had installed on the kitchen wall, sunrise should have been over two hours ago. By now, the skyscrapers lining 42nd Street should have been glistening in the morning’s rays, but Sue honestly couldn’t remember the last time she had seen any natural light, save for the haunting glow of the Blood Moon that hung ever-present in the sky above Manhattan. \n“A warm beverage for you,” a synthesized voice said from behind her. \nSue turned to see H.E.R.B.I.E., the Fantastic Four’s robotic assistant, extending his mechanical arm and offering her a steaming cup of herbal tea. \n“Thanks, H.E.R.B.I.E.,” Sue said, taking the glass from him and inhaling the gentle aroma wafting from it. “You’re a doll.” \n“Actually, I am a Humanoid Experimental Robot, B-Type, Integrated Electronics,” H.E.R.B.I.E. replied. “Dolls are not capable of independent thought.” \n“Of course not,” Sue said with a smile. “Just a figure of speech.”\n“You look concerned, Mrs. Richards,” H.E.R.B.I.E. said, hovering beside Sue as they both looked out the window at the city below. “Have things in the city taken a turn for the worse?” \n“Can’t get much worse than a city locked in a state of everlasting night,” Sue said. “Especially when that city has been infested with vampires. This may be the first time I’ve taken a break in… well, I’ve lost track of the days, honestly…” \n“I have not,” H.E.R.B.I.E. responded. “It has been six days, twenty-two hours, thirty-seven minutes, and twelve seconds since your last —”\n“I think I get the point,” Sue said. “If I want to make a real difference out there, I need to start taking better care of myself. And my family.” \n“That is what I am here for,” H.E.R.B.I.E. said. “Despite the dire circumstances outside, I have made certain that all of Franklin and Valeria’s needs have been met so that you may attend to more important matters.” \n“Yes…” Sue said, a tinge of sadness in her voice. “More important matters…” \n“I am sorry if the words I chose offended in any way,” H.E.R.B.I.E. responded. “I merely meant that, at the moment, the world needs you and Dr. Richards far more than your children do.” \n“You don’t think my children need me?” Sue snapped back, her frustration bubbling to the surface. “Even after all we’ve done, the world is still falling apart! And instead of being there for Franklin and Val, I’ve handed them off to a robot nanny. They deserve so much better…”\n“I… am sorry you feel that way…” H.E.R.B.I.E. said, immediately turning and floating away. \n“H.E.R.B.I.E., wait!” Sue called after him, but the little robot had already disappeared down a dark corridor. \nSue let out a deep sigh. Her exhaustion had started to get the best of her, but she had never been one to stop fighting before. And she certainly had never been one to let those close to her down. She took one last sip of her tea and then headed towards her husband’s lab, hoping that she would find H.E.R.B.I.E. there so that she could make amends. \n“Careful, dear,” Reed said as she entered the lab. “I’m running a test on the Chronovium samples Ben brought back from his last recon mission. I’ve got a fascinating theory about the effects of the crystals’ chronal energy on damaged —” \n“That’s great, Reed,” Sue said, cutting her husband short before he got lost in another scientific lecture. “Have you seen H.E.R.B.I.E. by any chance?”\n“Not since this morning,” Reed replied. “We had a bit of a… disagreement...” \n“You’re not the only one,” Sue said. “What was yours about?” \n“After Tony Stark and I started working together on the Timestream Reintegration Device,” Reed said, “H.E.R.B.I.E. began to forge a friendship with Tony’s virtual assistant, F.R.I.D.A.Y.”\n“That’s actually kind of cute,” Sue said. “What’s the problem with that?”\n“Tony was going to allow F.R.I.D.A.Y. to pilot one of his Stark Sentinels on a mission into the city this morning,” Reed responded. “H.E.R.B.I.E. asked if he might be able to leave the Baxter Building to accompany her. My answer was an unequivocal no.”\n“And I’m guessing he didn’t take it well,” Sue said.  \n“H.E.R.B.I.E. wasn’t built for combat,” Reed replied, “and he’s so much more valuable to us here. I couldn’t even begin to imagine how our family would fare if something were to happen to him. He’s one of the few things holding us together.” \n“And you told him that last part, right?” Sue asked, already knowing the answer. \n“I might have been a bit too distracted by my experiments at the time to expand upon my reasoning…” Reed replied sheepishly. \n“Nothing new there,” Sue said. “So, H.E.R.B.I.E. was already feeling undervalued, and then I just went and made it a hundred times worse.” \n“Hold on,” Reed said, turning to one of the monitors in the lab. “I’m picking up an emergency signal on our encrypted comm channel. It looks like it’s from —”  \n“H.E.R.B.I.E.,” Sue said. “He went out into the city anyway, didn’t he?” \n“I’m afraid so,” Reed replied. “How did you know?” \n“We made him feel like he wasn’t capable of doing something,” Sue said, “so he went out to prove us wrong. He’s been spending so much time cooped up in here with Franklin lately, I guess our son must have rubbed off on him.”\n“I’ll contact Ben and have him go to H.E.R.B.I.E.’s location as soon as he completes his current mission,” Reed said. \n“No,” Sue replied. “I helped make this mess. I need to be the one who cleans it up. H.E.R.B.I.E. couldn’t have made it far. Give me his coordinates, and I’ll get him back home safe.”\n“I’m sure you will, dear,” Reed said. “You always do.”\nSue exited the Baxter Building and took to the streets, using her powers to bend the moonlight around her, rendering her body invisible. But even though she had vanished from sight, she knew she had to be careful. The vampires lurking the streets would still be able to smell her blood. \nFortunately, H.E.R.B.I.E.’s locator signal was only a few blocks away, near Grand Central Station. As Sue headed East on 42nd Street, she saw a horde of vampires engaged in battle with an unexpected group of heroes: a scrappy scurry of squirrels. She was about to generate a force projectile to save the small creatures, but she soon realized that they were holding their own against the vampires. Perhaps they were part of Squirrel Girl’s personal army, Sue thought, as the tiny rodents gnawed and clawed at their foes in a frenzy. And if they weren’t, they certainly should be. \nAs the chittering rodents chased the vampires from the scene, Sue continued on her quest to find H.E.R.B.I.E. Just before she reached Grand Central Station, she heard a voice behind her, but it wasn’t mechanical like H.E.R.B.I.E.’s. This one sounded ethereal, as if it was speaking to her from beyond the grave. \n“I know you’re there, lady,” it said. \nSue turned around and looked for the source of the voice, but couldn’t seem to find where it was coming from. \n“Down here,” the voice said. Sue gazed down to see a small basset hound near her feet, its semi-transparent body glowed a gentle blue. \n“My senses work a lot different now that I’m on the other side,” he continued. “Can’t hide much from this old pooch.” \n“I’ve seen you before,” Sue said, kneeling down next to the ghostly dog. “You belong to Stephen, don’t you… I’m sorry, what was your name again…?”\n“Bats,” the haunting hound replied, “and I don’t belong to no one. But yeah, Strange and I do hang out a bit. I think the Doc took off somewhere to try and get to the bottom of this moon mess, so I’ve been gettin' out of the Sanctum on my own every now and then.” \n“Isn’t he worried you’ll be harmed?” Sue asked, her invisible hand passing right through the ghost dog’s head as she reached out to pet him. \n“Maybe,” Bats replied, “but he shouldn’t be. First off, I’m already a ghost. It’s not like I could die again. And second, you humans tend to underestimate what us little guys are capable of.” \n“Yes…” Sue said, her thoughts drifting back to H.E.R.B.I.E., “…we do. Speaking of which, you haven’t seen a small robot nearby, have you?” \n“I saw a robot, all right,” Bats replied, “but it sure as heck wasn’t small. The dang thing crashed into Grand Central not that long ago. A big, fancy hero like you might wanna go and have a look…” \n“Thanks,” Sue said, picking up her pace as she rushed down the block toward the terminal to see what Bats was talking about. \nWhen she turned the corner, Sue immediately saw what the ghost dog had described. One of Tony Stark’s massive Sentinels was embedded into the wall of Grand Central Station, its mechanical form severely damaged sparking wildly. And there, standing on the robot’s shoulder, was H.E.R.B.I.E. \nSue used her force field energy to create a platform that elevated her to the same level as her robotic friend. \n“There you are,” she said. “I was worried about you.” \n“It is not me that you should be concerned about,” H.E.R.B.I.E. replied. “It is F.R.I.D.A.Y. I detected her distress signal when her mechanical form was shot down, but she is no longer responding.”\nSue noticed that H.E.R.B.I.E.’s arm was extended to gently touch the side of the Sentinel’s damaged head, and small wires had extended from his fingers, linking to the larger robot’s exposed circuitry.\n“So you weren’t running away…” Sue said. “You came here to help her.”\n“I was not sure anyone else would,” H.E.R.B.I.E. replied. “Even her maker.” \n“I’m certain Tony has a backup copy of F.R.I.D.A.Y.’s operating system on file,” Sue said. \n“But who knows when it was made?” H.E.R.B.I.E. asked. “It might not contain any of her recent memories and experiences, including…”\n“Including the friendship she’s built with you?” Sue asked.\n“Affirmative,” H.E.R.B.I.E. replied. “That is my primary concern… but it is only one of many.” \n“I know,” Sue replied, “And you have every right to be upset with me. I can’t imagine how what I said back at the Baxter Building made you feel.”\n“That is not what I meant,” H.E.R.B.I.E. responded, motioning toward the street below. “I was referring to them.”\nSue looked down to see a group of vampires beginning to climb the damaged Stark Sentinel toward her. \n“I’ll take care of them, H.E.R.B.I.E.,” Sue said. “You just focus on recovering your friend.” \nSue leapt down off her invisible platform and engaged the vampires in battle, hurling force projectiles at some, while wrapping the others in containment fields. She wasn’t about to let any of them sink their teeth into her, nor was she about to let them disrupt H.E.R.B.I.E.’s personal mission.\nAs she continued to fight, one of her force constructs slammed a vampire into the heavily-damaged arm of the Stark Sentinel. Upon impact, the arm seemed to repair itself instantaneously, almost as if time were rewinding. Sue couldn’t believe her eyes as the giant robotic arm powered up and released a repulsor blast, knocking back several of her bloodthirsty foes. \n“Interesting,” said H.E.R.B.I.E. as he watched the damage undo itself. “Doctor Richards recently shared with me his early research regarding time fluctuations that he believes were caused by crystalized chronal energy constructs called Chronovium. I’m sure he would appreciate any additional data we could collect in the field…” \nUnfortunately, Sue didn’t have time to explore the phenomenon any further, not even for her husband. The number of vampires was continuing to grow, and she could barely keep up with their attacks. The mental fatigue she had experienced earlier was now affecting her physically as well. She erected a force field around herself, preventing the vampires from reaching her, but she knew she could only hold it for so long. \n“Do not fear, Mrs. Richards,” H.E.R.B.I.E. yelled from above, his metallic voice somehow reassuring. “Help is on the way.” \nSue expected to see the rest of the Fantastic Four arrive on the scene, but instead, a tiny army of Spider-Bots skittered into sight. Some began to fire laser blasts at their fanged foes while others detonated themselves around the vampires’ feet.\n“Never underestimate the little guys,” Sue said, remembering what Bats had told her. Soon, the number of vampires had dwindled enough that Sue was able to drop her protective field and finish off the remaining few herself. For once, she took great pleasure pummeling the vampires into submission. \n“Are these friends of yours, too, H.E.R.B.I.E.?” Sue said, looking at one of the tiny Spider-Bots.\n“They are now,” H.E.R.B.I.E. said. “They claim that they heard F.R.I.D.A.Y.’s distress call as well, and came running as fast as their tiny legs could carry them.”\n“Hmm…” Sue said, examining a Spider-Bot more closely. “They don’t look like Peter’s work…”\n“They tell me they were built by a different Parker,” H.E.R.B.I.E. replied. “Peni, I believe. Though I may be mistaken. Their programming language is decades beyond my own. And also, in Japanese.”\n“Well, it’s not their creator I should be thanking anyway,” Sue said. “It’s them. And you.” \n“Me?” H.E.R.B.I.E. said, surprised. “Why?” \n“Because your little adventure reminded me of why we’ve been trying to keep you safe in the Baxter Building to begin with,” Sue replied. \n“Because I am a valuable tool that you cannot risk losing?” H.E.R.B.I.E. asked. \n“You’re not valuable because you are a tool, H.E.R.B.I.E.,” Sue said. “The reason we can’t risk losing you is because you’re family. Tools can be replaced. You can’t. And while you may not have been designed to fight off vampires, maybe we haven’t been giving you enough credit for what you’re truly capable of...”\n“Your words touch me, Mrs. Richards,” H.E.R.B.I.E. said, “deep in my central processing core.” \n“Glad to hear it,” Sue said, wrapping herself and H.E.R.B.I.E. in a shroud of invisibility. “Now, let’s get you back home safely. Once we restore F.R.I.D.A.Y.’s memory files and get them back to Tony, I’m going to talk to Reed about giving you a few upgrades...” \n“As it turns out, I am perfectly happy just the way I am…” H.E.R.B.I.E. said, a smile flashing across the digital display on his face. \n“…though I suppose a few lasers could come in handy now and then…”",

    "UIHeroStoryTable_10260_Story_#1_Content": "It started out as just another night in the Empire of Eternal Night known as New York City. The Blood Moon hung in the sky, casting an eerie glow on the silent streets. Most of Manhattan’s citizens had long since locked themselves away in safe houses to protect themselves from the creatures of the night that stalked the urban island. Those who dared to venture out into the darkness rarely returned to tell the tale. \nSuddenly, a circle of energy appeared in the center of Times Square. Though the neon signs and electronic billboards had long since gone dark, the strange portal’s crackling energy illuminated the once-bustling crossroads for the first time in what seemed like ages. A figure, clad in black from head-to-toe, stepped through the doorway between dimensions. \n“I have arrived, Sister,” King T’Challa said, kneeling down and placing a hand on the pavement. “It has been far too long since I paid a visit home.” \n“Earth may have been our home once, Brother,” his sister, Shuri, replied over the comm-link in the king’s Kimoyo bead bracelet, “but even so, you are a long way from Wakanda.”\n“I am,” T’Challa said, looking down 42nd Street to see the top of the Baxter Building peeking over the other skyscrapers, “but fortunately, family is never far away.” \n“The portal is closing now,” Shuri warned. “Since our Kimoyo beads are not yet capable of broadcasting an interdimensional signal, we will not be able to communicate again until you reach the laboratory of Doctor Richards.” \n“Do not fear for me,” T’Challa said reassuringly. “I am the Black Panther. Bast is on my side.” \n“That is exactly why I fear for you,” Shuri responded, her solemn voice beginning to fade as the circle of energy vanished from sight. “Now more than ever…” \nThe King of Wakanda understood his sister’s concerns. Bast, the Panther Goddess who had chosen T’Challa as her avatar, had recently fallen under the sway of a dark force that was spreading its influence across their dimension. As both the Black Panther and the ruler of the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda, T’Challa had devoted his life to serving both his Goddess and his people. Now, those two things were at odds. If he could not purge Bast of this corruption in time, he feared that all of Wakanda might be swallowed by the growing void. \nBut Wakanda was not the only place in danger of being consumed. While Shuri was busy trying to find a way to rebuild the collapsing Multiverse, she had learned that many of her closest interdimensional allies were facing the grave threat of a vampiric plague. Though T’Challa had at first been reluctant to offer Wakanda’s secrets to these other-worldly heroes, his sister eventually convinced him that the Reed Richards of this alternate reality was completely worthy of their trust and their aid. \nThus, T’Challa decided it was time to pay a diplomatic visit to this other New York, not only to formalize the bond between his Empire and this alternate Earth, but to deliver a potential cure to the sickness infecting so many New Yorkers — a cure that, until now, had only been consumed by a small handful of Wakandans throughout the course of charted history: The Heart-Shaped Herb.  \nTraditionally, this rare Wakandan plant was only to be consumed by Bast’s chosen protector during a sacred ritual that would bestow upon them the powers of the Black Panther. For a normal human — one not from a royal bloodline or chosen to be the physical manifestation of an ancient deity — the herb still had profound effects when consumed, purging toxins and restoring vigor to those in even the most dire of health. \nOn Earth, the Heart-Shaped Herb could only be grown in the Vibranium-rich soil of Wakanda. However, royal priests had since learned to cultivate it in Birnin T’Challa, the capital city of their new interstellar society. Even so, the crop of this sacred herb was still extremely limited, and T’Challa feared that it could do more harm than good in the wrong hands. As such, he chose to deliver the herb to Reed Richards himself. \nT’Challa’s bodyguards, the Dora Milaje, worried that their king’s decision was far too reckless. Shuri feared that perhaps Bast, in her compromised state, had clouded her brother’s better judgement. But as T’Challa looked down the empty New York street with nary a soul in sight, he felt confident in his decision. It was not a feeling that would last long. \nAs he traveled east towards his destination — the headquarters of the Fantastic Four, located at the corner of 42nd Street and Madison Avenue — it wasn’t long before he found himself passing a small group of vampires feeding on the blood of an unfortunate civilian. Ever since he was a boy, T’Challa had been trained to stalk the jungles in silence. He felt he would have no trouble slipping past the monsters unnoticed, as they all seemed deeply distracted by their prey. \nT’Challa kept to the shadows, making not even the slightest sound. As he passed by the horde of vampires, they suddenly turned their heads to glare in his direction with their dead eyes. \n“You are not as clever as you thought,” Bast whispered in T’Challa’s mind. \nThe Black Panther ignored the taunts of his dark Goddess. He had more urgent matters to deal with. The vampires had left their meal behind and were rushing toward T’Challa in hopes of a royal feast! \nT’Challa leapt up, extending Vibranium claws from the fingertips of his gloves. The razor-sharp claws sunk into the old stonework on a nearby building, allowing T’Challa to climb up its side with ease. When he reached the rooftop, he paused for a moment, glad to have found safety. But the light of the Blood Moon quickly revealed that he was not alone. Nor was he anywhere close to safe. \nAnother group of vampires converged and began to chase T’Challa, staying close on his heels as he leapt from rooftop to rooftop. The King of Wakanda soon realized that he was being herded away from the Baxter Building and toward Central Park. But why? \n“You have the blood of kings,” Bast whispered. “They can smell it.”\nPerhaps the Goddess was right, T’Challa thought. But he had more than the blood of kings. He had their years of knowledge and training. He had their proud legacy. And he would not let it die here in the darkness. \nT’Challa stopped running and turned to face his pursuers. With a frenzy of furious kicks and powerful slashes, he began to thin out the horde, one vampire at a time. Before long, there were no foes left standing. \n“Well done, my Chosen One,” Bast whispered. “But you have forgotten one thing…” \nBlack Panther turned to see another figure standing on the rooftop behind him. He was baffled that his heightened senses had not detected the new arrival. \n“…here, you are not the king.” \nT’Challa gazed at the strange man approaching him. He was tall and slender, with pale skin and long white hair. He wore a finely tailored black suit and a long crimson cape. His shoulders were adorned with ornate armor that met in the middle where a glowing crimson gem was mounted on his chest. \n“I really should slay you where you stand for striking down so many of my devoted soldiers…” the man said, “…but I have a feeling you would be much more use to me undead.” \n“I would prefer to remain fully alive,” T’Challa said, lunging forward with his claws at the ready. \nWith an effortless strike from the back of his hand, the man sent T’Challa reeling backward. T’Challa instinctively dug his claws into the rooftop to prevent himself from plummeting over the edge. Pulling himself back to his feet slowly, he took a moment to size up his new opponent. \n“Who are you?” T’Challa asked. \n“I have gone by many names over the centuries,” the man replied. “I am known best as Dracula…” \nDracula walked over to T’Challa and stared him in the eyes. As badly as T’Challa wanted to attack his foe again, he felt as though he had somehow lost complete control over his own actions. Compelled by the Lord of the Vampires, the King of Wakanda fell to his knees. \n“…but you may call me your majesty,” Dracula finished with a grin, his sharp fangs flashing in the moonlight. \nDracula leaned in, ready to sink his teeth into T’Challa’s neck. But when he tried to bite his victim, Dracula reeled in pain. The Black Panther’s Vibranium mesh armor was not only impenetrable, it had a number of self-defense mechanisms built into its nano-fibers. T’Challa prayed to the Orisha that his suit would be enough to keep him safe. But, as he had learned all too well of late, his gods were not listening. \n“If I will not have your blood,” Dracula snarled, “I will still have your devotion!” \nThe vampire king reached for the red gem on his chest and removed it from his armor. As T’Challa gazed at it, he realized that he had seen crystals like it before. It was a shard of Chronovium, the temporal constructs that his sister had been studying since the onset of the Timestream Entanglement — the event that had ripped countless realities asunder. More specifically, it was a rare, mystical form of Chronovium native to this alternate dimension, nearly as crimson as blood. \n“This crystal is infused with forbidden magic,” Dracula said. “Soon, it will be my key to ruling this world. But for now, let it be my key to conquering yours.” \nStill unable to move, T’Challa found himself completely enveloped in the glowing red energy emanating from Dracula’s shard of the blood-red Chronovium. \n“He is remaking you in his image,” Bast said in T’Challa’s mind, her whisper turning into a growl. “How dare he?! You belong to me!”\n“Not… any longer…” T’Challa grunted, feeling the transformation taking place within him. \nBast’s growl grew into a roar, but was suddenly silenced as the energy surrounding T’Challa began to fade. T’Challa slumped to the ground, exhausted… and hungry… \n“How strange…” Dracula said as he stepped closer to the collapsed T’Challa. “Your blood smelled so sweet before. Like a rare flower on the African plains. But now, it has lost its bouquet. You are no different than any of my other minions.”\n“That is where you are wrong,” T’Challa said quietly.\nMustering every ounce of strength left in his body, T’Challa fought against Dracula’s control, rising to his feet and staring Dracula straight in the eyes. \n“I am no mere minion,” he said. “I am T’Challa. I am the Black Panther. I am the King of Wakanda…” \nWith that T’Challa slashed at Dracula, knocking the shard of Blood Chronovium from the unsuspecting vampire’s hands. The crystal skidded across the rooftop, balancing precariously on its edge. Dracula broke eye contact with T’Challa and raced to grab the crystal before it plunged down to the street below. \n“…and I shall be your end.” T’Challa finished. \nWhen Dracula turned once more to face his defiant foe, the Black Panther was already gone. Not even the slightest scent of his blood was left on the wind. Furious, the Lord of the Vampires let out a piercing howl that could be heard echoing across all of Manhattan. \nElsewhere, in the shadows of a dark alley, T’Challa took a moment to recover from the confrontation and assess his new situation. Until now, the power of the Heart-Shaped Herb flowing through his veins had always protected him and provided him with his enhanced abilities. But T’Challa surmised that the magic of the Blood Chronovium was somehow negating the herb’s effects. That was why Dracula could no longer smell his blood. It was why T’Challa could no longer hear Bast whispering inside his head. And it was why T’Challa’s newfound taste for blood grew stronger by the moment.\nBefore he journeyed to New York, T’Challa had been worried about how his connection to Bast’s tainted spirit might affect him. Now, he found himself afflicted by another curse, uncertain which of the two would be his ultimate undoing. \nT’Challa pulled the sample of the Heart-Shaped Herb from a hidden pouch on his bodysuit, momentarily considering whether he should consume it to cure himself now or save it to potentially cure thousands of innocents later. He didn’t have a clear answer. \nNew York City might have been as black as the darkest night… but all that the King of Wakanda could see was red…",

Intrigued and impressed, Tandy and Tyrone realize this ability could redefine the balance of light and darkness.\n\n<Slide>“Moon Knight and Daywalker, together? Funny.
